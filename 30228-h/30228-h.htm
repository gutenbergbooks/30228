<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>A GRAPEFRUIT PRELUDE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Splash! The grapefruit hit her in the eye!</p>
<p>Splash! His psychic wave was dashed to smithereens!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; the two girls screamed in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;!&rdquo; the young man sitting near ejaculated.</p>
<p>For ten minutes there in the Oak Room of the Ritz-Carlton
he had been hurling across the narrow intervening
space this mental command to the girl facing
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here! Look at me! Let me see your eyes!
Look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For half that time she had been conscious of his
insistent gaze and his message. But with as much
will power as he himself displayed she bent her head
over her plate and sent back along his telepathic transmission
this reply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t! I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she was weakening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie,&rdquo; she said to her companion, &ldquo;I do awfully
want to look up. I want to see who is looking at me
so fiercely. I can just feel it all through me. Of
course it wouldn&rsquo;t be proper, would it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that all depends on who is looking at you,
dear, doesn&rsquo;t it? If it were some horrid old man&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it doesn&rsquo;t feel a bit like that, Sadie. I don&rsquo;t
know just how to explain it&ndash;&ndash;really it isn&rsquo;t unpleasant
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Helen! And you engaged and going to
elo&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Sadie, you mustn&rsquo;t say that in here. Somebody
might&ndash;&ndash;but I positively cannot keep my eyes
down another moment. I&rsquo;m&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Then splash!</p>
<p>A vicious little jab of the spoon and there followed
a disastrous geyser&ndash;&ndash;a grapefruit geyser.</p>
<p>With a smothered little cry of pain Helen&rsquo;s eyes
shut tight and she groped for her napkin. And to
make a good job of it the Fates dragged in at that
moment Helen&rsquo;s guardian aunt, the tall and statuesque
Mrs. Elvira Burton of Omaha, Neb.</p>
<p>The young man who had failed so signally in what
was perhaps his maiden effort at hypnotism viciously
seized all the change the waiter proffered on the little
silver tray, flung it back with a snarl, got up and
stamped out of the room.</p>
<p>He was a mighty good looking chap, smartly attired,
and if you care for details, he wore a heliotrope
scarf in which there gleamed a superb black pearl for
which he had paid a superb price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat it!&rdquo; he muttered as he climbed the
stairs to the lobby and mingled with the throng that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
stood about in stiff groups, idly chattering and looking
as if they bored one another to the verge of desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat it!&rdquo; he exclaimed again, fairly biting
off the words.</p>
<p>So vehemently occupied was he with his chagrin and
annoyance that he stamped heavily upon the pet corn
of a retired rear admiral, rudely bumped a Roumanian
duchess, kicked the pink poodle of a famous prima
donna and brought up with a thud against the heroic
brawn and muscle of the house detective, who stood
as solidly in the middle of the lobby as if he had
taken root somewhere down in the foundations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I beat what?&rdquo; asked the house detective frigidly.</p>
<p>My, but he was an angry young man, and he fairly
snarled at the magnificent individual he had collided
with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat a drum, beat an egg, beat around the bush&ndash;&ndash;go
as far as you like&ndash;&ndash;beat your grandmother if you
prefer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The granite faced house detective was not used to
that sort of treatment; furthermore it distinctly galled
him to be asked to beat his grandmother, whom he
recalled as an estimable old lady who made an odd
noise when she ate soup, owing to an absence of teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you said about my grandmother?&rdquo; he
said, bridling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother your grandmother,&rdquo; shot back the insolent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
retort, whereat the lordly house detective plucked the
young man by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Staggerin&rsquo; an&rsquo; loony talk don&rsquo;t go in the Ritz,&rdquo;
he said under his breath. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been havin&rsquo; too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo; exclaimed the young man, vainly
endeavoring to shake his arm free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a guest of the house?&rdquo; demanded the immaculately
garbed minion of the Ritz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, so kindly remove the pair of pincers you are
crushing my arm with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;that is, I&rsquo;ve forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know you need lookin&rsquo; after. Come over
here to the desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house detective had manifested no more outward
passion than a block of ice, and so adroit was
he in marching the young man to the desk that not an
eye in the lobby was attracted to the little scene.</p>
<p>The young man was at first inclined to make a fuss
about it and demand an abject apology for this untoward
treatment. The absurdity of his predicament,
however, stirred his sense of humor and he was meekly
docile when his captor arraigned him at the desk
and addressed one of the clerks:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this young man, Mr. Horton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, Reagan&ndash;&ndash;this is Mr. Smith&ndash;&ndash;why&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&ndash;&ndash;Smith!&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;How
could I ever forget that name? Thomas Smith, isn&rsquo;t
it, Mr. Horton, or is it James?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas, of course; at least that&rsquo;s the way you
registered, Mr. Smith&ndash;&ndash;Thomas Smith and valet.&rdquo;
The clerk&rsquo;s eyebrows started straight up his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas Smith, exactly. Now are you satisfied,
Mr. House Detective, or do you want to go up and
examine my luggage? Having convinced you that I
am a registered guest, how would you like to have
me walk a chalk line and convince you that I am
sober?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house detective froze up tighter than ever,
pivoted on his heel and walked majestically away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble, Mr. Smith?&rdquo; asked the clerk
deferentially, for he was a better student of exteriors
than John Reagan, twenty years a precinct detective
and retired to take up the haughtier r&ocirc;le of plain-clothes
man in this most fastidious of metropolitan
hostelries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all, old chap,&rdquo; laughed the young
man. &ldquo;I lost my little <i>capri</i>, and then by accident I
discovered a stray member of the herd belonging to
yonder Ajax. Some day he&rsquo;s going to turn into solid
marble from the dome down, when you will have a
most extraordinary piece of statuary on your hands.
By the way, have there been any telephone messages
for me? I am expecting a very important one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; said the clerk briskly, and
began searching through the pigeonholes. &ldquo;Yes, Mr.
Whitney Barnes called up&ndash;&ndash;left word he would call
up again at 2 sharp. Will you be in your room, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;ll be safe in my room?&rdquo; asked the
young man solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe!&rdquo; exclaimed the clerk. &ldquo;Why, what do you
mean, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, only Sir Ivory Ajax seems suspicious
of me and might take it into his head to come up and
see if I hadn&rsquo;t murdered my valet. That&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m
going to my room now to wait for Mr. Barnes&rsquo;s telephone
call. Kindly be sure that he is connected with
my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> something strange about that young fellow,&rdquo;
murmured the clerk as he watched the object
of suspicion vanish into the lift. &ldquo;Though if he is
a friend of Whitney Barnes,&rdquo; the clerk added after
a pause, &ldquo;he ought to be all right. I think I&rsquo;ll look
him up in the Social Register.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which he did&ndash;&ndash;without enlightenment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>MR. HOGG ENTERS THE LISTS.</h3>
</div>
<p>Having arrived in the grill room of the Ritz coincident
with a devastating eruption of grapefruit, Mrs.
Elvira Burton set out forthwith to demonstrate that
her unexpected advent was likewise somewhat in the
nature of a lemon. Even her smile was acid as she
spread out her rich sable furs and sat down at the
table with her two pretty nieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just received a letter from Mr. Hogg,
Helen,&rdquo; she began with a rush, regardless of the anguish
that was still evident in Helen&rsquo;s lovely grapefruit
bespattered eyes.</p>
<p>A twinge of something more than mere physical
pain twisted the young girl&rsquo;s features at the mention
of the name&ndash;&ndash;Hogg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, auntie,&rdquo; she almost sobbed, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you leave
Mr. Hogg out of my luncheon. We had him last
night for dinner and again this morning for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Burton in accents of bitter
reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just won&rsquo;t have him for luncheon, and with all
this grapefruit in my eye,&rdquo; insisted Helen, hotly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It must hurt terribly,&rdquo; sympathized Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
other pretty charge, then twisted her head and
looked behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at, Sadie?&rdquo; demanded Mrs.
Burton, suspiciously.</p>
<p>Sadie turned with a start and blushed furiously.
She started to stammer a reply when the less timid
cousin came to her rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some ridiculous man was trying to flirt with us
and we were both awfully nervous. I suppose Sadie
looked to see if <i>you</i> had frightened him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blushing Sadie was amazed at her cousin&rsquo;s resourcefulness,
and stole a glance from under the curling
fuzz of her golden bang to note the effect produced
upon her august guardian and aunt. Mrs. Burton
groped in her mind for some subtlety that might
have been contained in her niece&rsquo;s remark, failed at
any plausible solution and then almost vindictively returned
to her original line of attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen Burton, I must insist that you listen to me.
I have broken an engagement for the matin&eacute;e with
my friend, Mrs. Hobbs-Smathers of Chicago, for the
express purpose of communicating to you the contents
of Mr. Hogg&rsquo;s letter. He informs me, Helen, that
you are treating him scandalously; that you do not
pay the slightest attention to his letters or even answer
his telegrams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say he was getting thin&ndash;&ndash;that would be
charming,&rdquo; teased the incorrigible Helen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Burton gasped and the color surged into her
cheeks in two flaming danger signals. The glance
she turned upon the mischievously laughing eyes of
her niece was intended to annihilate every vestige of
frivolity. Her ample bosom struggled in its purple
velvet casement. Sadie Burton actually shook in
her tiny boots as she pictured her aunt in one of her
hysterical outbursts right there in the midst of a host
of strangers who seemed to the unsophisticated miss
from Omaha to represent the very cream of New
York society.</p>
<p>Even Helen was sobered by the gathering storm
warnings. The smile left her curving red lips and
the dimples vanished. All that lingered of her playful
humor showed in the impish lights that danced
in her expressive eyes.</p>
<p>But she was spared the storm. A tiny page, resplendant
with myriad buttons, appeared in the entrance
to the Oak Room and lisped the name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mith Helen Burthon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bore in his arms a bouquet of magnificent orchids.
Every eye in the room focussed upon the tiny
flower bearer, among them the wrathful pair of
Mrs. Elvira Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mith Helen Burthon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rage of the older woman had somewhat cooled.
She managed to nod her head haughtily to the boy.
He came forward briskly with his precious burden
of blooms and laid them on the table, then right-about-faced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
with military precision and marched
away.</p>
<p>Now it was Helen Burton&rsquo;s turn to blush and
her agitation was as pretty to see as anything those
who continued to stare in her direction had ever witnessed.
Her dimples were positive hollows from
which her blushes seemed to fountain. She did not
reach for the bouquet, though, because her hand
trembled so and there was actual fear in her eyes
as she shrank back in her seat and regarded her aunt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton was not loath to seize upon any leverage
that might give her sway over her rebellious
niece. With a smile that was unequivocally malicious
she slowly raised the bunch of orchids and turned
them over. The bouquet was tied with a delicate
mauve satin ribbon that perfectly matched the gown
worn by her niece.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton looked at the ribbon and then at
Helen&rsquo;s dress. There was accusation in the glance.
Her eyes studied the orchids. They were of a peculiar
rich golden brown, matching the splendor of Miss
Burton&rsquo;s hair. There was conviction in the second
glance. She turned the bouquet over several times,
looking for a card.</p>
<p>There was none.</p>
<p>Now, here was a mystery! Could Miss Helen explain?
Mrs. Burton inhaled a deep breath, then said
with exaggerated sweetness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen, dear, who could have sent you these beautiful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
flowers? They are positively superb. He must
certainly be an artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great as was her first panic, the young girl quickly
rallied to her own defense. She had only waited to
be sure there was no card, no incriminating mark of
identification. She leaned forward on her elbows,
sighed rapturously and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they exquisite, Aunt El!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked you, Helen dear, who could have sent
them?&rdquo; There was something distinctly feline in
the purring tones as the question was repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, isn&rsquo;t there any card, Aunt El?&rdquo; fenced the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, my dear, why keep me in suspense?
You can see there is no card. Can it be one of the
young men we met at the Grangers last night? I
hardly think so, for it is execrably bad form to send
flowers to a public dining room by a page in buttons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen shook her head and assumed an air of great
perplexity. She stole a glance across the table at
Sadie, but that shy little cousin seemed on the verge
of tears. Mrs. Burton intercepted the wireless appeal
and shifted her cross-questioning to Sadie. She
was determined to unravel the mystery. She read
Sadie&rsquo;s panic as a symptom of guilty knowledge.</p>
<p>But Sadie was loyal to the cousin and chum she
adored and proved surprisingly game under fire. Indeed,
she succeeded in breaking down her aunt&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
cross-examination and bringing the inquest to ruins
by suddenly clapping her hands and blurting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Mr. Hogg sent them by telegraph.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outrageous absurdity of the statement gave
it cataclysmic force. Helen embraced Sadie with her
eyes and then added her own broadside:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That really was splendid of him, Auntie El? Now
you can tell me all about his letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will reserve that until later,&rdquo; said Mrs. Burton,
icily. &ldquo;If you have finished your luncheon, Helen,
please pay the check and we shall go.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>WHITNEY BARNES UNDER FIRE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Joshua Barnes, sometimes referred to in the
daily press as Old Grim Barnes, the mustard millionaire,
turned suddenly upon his son and pinioned him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, pater&ndash;&ndash;why don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; replied the
young man, blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you, then?&rdquo; stormed Joshua
Barnes, banging his fist down upon the mahogany
table. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another bang lifted the red-headed office boy in
the next room clear out of Deep Blood Gulch just as
Derringer Dick was rescuing the beautiful damsel
from the Apaches. Even Miss Featherington dropped
&ldquo;The Mystery of the Purple Room&rdquo; on the floor and
made a wild onslaught on the keys of her typewriter.</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes smiled benevolently upon his parent
and nonchalantly lighted a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I&rsquo;ve said before,&rdquo; he parried easily between
the puffing of smoke rings, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t found the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dod rot the girl,&rdquo; started Joshua Barnes, then
stopped.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you know, my dear father, that I couldn&rsquo;t
treat my wife like that. The trouble with you, pater,
is that you reason from false premises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; choked out Barnes senior.
&ldquo;You know well enough what I mean, young man.
You have any number of&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;well, eligible young
ladies, to choose from. You go everywhere and meet
everybody. And you spend my money like water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has got to spend it,&rdquo; spoke up the sole
heir to the mustard millions, cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what I&rsquo;ll do, pater&ndash;&ndash;you stop making it and I&rsquo;ll stop
spending it. That&rsquo;s a bargain. It&rsquo;ll be a great lark
for us both. It keeps me awake nights figuring out
how I&rsquo;m going to spend it and it keeps you awake
nights puzzling over how you can make it&ndash;&ndash;or, that
is, make more of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stop</i>!&rdquo; thundered Joshua Barnes. &ldquo;For once in
my life, Whitney Barnes, I am going to have a serious
talk with you. If your poor mother had only
lived all this wouldn&rsquo;t have been necessary. She&rsquo;d
have had you married off and there&rsquo;d be a houseful
of grand-children by this time, and&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, pater&ndash;&ndash;did triplets or that sort
of thing ever run in our family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! What are you driving at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing; nothing, my father. Only I was just
wondering. We have a pretty big house, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Joshua Barnes seemed on the verge
of apoplexy, but he came around quickly, and moreover
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
with a twinkle in his eye. Even a life devoted to
mustard has its brighter side and Old Grim Barnes
was not entirely devoid of a sense of humor. He was
his grim old self again, however, when he resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again I insist that you be serious. I intend that
you shall be married within a year. Otherwise I will
put you to work on a salary of ten dollars a week and
compel you to live on it. If you persist in refusing to
interest yourself in my business, the business that my
grandfather founded and that my father and I built
up, you can at least settle down and lead a respectable
married life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be candid with you, Whitney,&rdquo; and Joshua
Barnes&rsquo;s big voice suddenly softened, &ldquo;I want to see
some little grand-children round me before I die. I
have some pride of blood, my boy, and I want to see
our name perpetuated. You have frivolled enough,
Whitney. You are twenty-four. I can honestly
thank God that you&rsquo;ve been nothing more than a fool.
You are not vicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, awfully, pater. Being nothing more
than a fool I suppose it is up to me to get married.
Very well, then, I will. Give me your hand, dad;
it&rsquo;s a bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes tossed away his cigarette and
grasped his father&rsquo;s hand in both of his. He had
become intensely serious. There was a depth of affection
in that handclasp that neither father nor son
permitted to show above the surface. Yet both felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
it keenly within. Picking up his hat and stick, the
tall, slim, graceful young man said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no further commands on the subject,
dad? Do you want to pick the girl, or will you leave
it to the taste and sometimes good judgment of a
fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you any one in mind, son?&rdquo; asked Joshua
Barnes, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely not one, pater. You see, the trouble
is that I can&rsquo;t ever seem to get real chummy with a
girl but what her mother has to come and camp on
my trail and scare me into fits. You haven&rsquo;t the least
idea what a catch your son is, Joshua Barnes. Why,
a mother-in-law looks to me like something in petticoats
that comes creeping up with a catlike tread,
carrying in one hand a net and in the other a bale-hook.
I can&rsquo;t sit out two dances with a debutante
before this nightmare is looking over my shoulder,
grinning like a gargoyle and counting up the number
of millions you are going to leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bosh!&rdquo; ejaculated Joshua Barnes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
in your fool imagination. Grow up and be a man,
Whitney. You have given me your word and I expect
you to make good. And by the way, son, there
is my old friend Charley Calker&rsquo;s girl, just out of college.
I hear she&rsquo;s a stunner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Calker is a stunner, dad, and then a trifle.
But I regret to say that she is too fresh from the
cloistered halls of learning. You see I have been out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
of college three years and have managed to forget
such a jolly lot that I really couldn&rsquo;t talk to her.
She&rsquo;d want me to make love in Latin and correspond
in Greek. Worse than that, she understands Browning.
No, poor Mary will have to marry a prescription
clerk, or a florist or something else out of the
classics. But, don&rsquo;t lose heart, pater, I may be engaged
before night. By-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a vastly more solemn Whitney Barnes who
strolled out of the office of the mustard magnate and
dragged his feet through the anteroom where sat
Marietta Featherington and Teddie O&rsquo;Toole. The
comely Miss Featherington could scarcely believe
what she saw from under her jutting puffs.</p>
<p>This good looking, dandified young man, with his
perpetual smile and sparkling gray eyes had long been
her conception of all that was noble and cultured and
aristocratic. He was her Viscount Reginald Vere de
Vere, speaking to her as from between yellow paper
covers. He was her prince incognito who fell in love
with Lily, the Lovely Laundress. He had threaded
the mazes of more than one of her palpitating dreams,
and in her innermost heart of hearts she had cherished
the fond belief that one day their orbs would
meet and their souls would rush together in such a
head-on collision as is sometimes referred to as love
at first sight. But in Miss Featherington&rsquo;s hero worship
gloom had no part. Her ideals never ceased to
smile, whether they slew or caressed, and perpetually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
they carried themselves with a jaunty swing or a
dashing stride.</p>
<p>The fact that there had been storm mutterings
within the awful cave of Old Grim Barnes had never
before had a depressing effect upon her hero. He
had always sallied forth with airy tread, humming a
tune or laughing with his eyes. What could have
happened at this fateful meeting? Perhaps he had
been disinherited. Rapture of raptures, he had confessed
his love for some howling beauty of humble
station, had been cut off with the inevitable shilling
and was now going forth to earn his bread.</p>
<p>Marietta Featherington&rsquo;s heart came up and
throbbed in her throat as Whitney Barnes suddenly
wheeled and confronted her. Leaning back upon his
cane, he looked at her&ndash;&ndash;very, very solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Featherington,&rdquo; he pronounced slowly, &ldquo;I
wish to ask you a question. May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marietta was sure that her puffs were on fire, so
fierce was the heat that blazed under her fair skin.
She concentrated all her mental forces in an effort to
summon an elegant reply. But all she could get out
was a stifled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Featherington,&rdquo; said the young
man. &ldquo;My question is this: Do you believe in soul
mates? That is, do you, judging from what you have
observed and any experience you may have had, believe
that true love is controlled by the hand of Fate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
or that you yourself can take hold and guide your
own footsteps in affairs of the heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teddie O&rsquo;Toole had crammed &ldquo;Deep Blood Gulch&rdquo;
into his hip pocket and was grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Miss Featherington was positive that her puffs
were all ablaze. She could almost smell them burning.
She looked down and she looked up and she
drew a long, desperate sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in Fate!&rdquo; she said with emotion that
would have done honor to Sarah Bernhardt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Featherington,&rdquo; said Whitney
Barnes, with profound respect, then turned on his
heel and went out into the corridor of the great office
building.</p>
<p>Unconsciously he had dealt a ruthless blow and
there is not a scintilla of doubt but that he was responsible
for the box on the ears that made Teddie
O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s head ring for the remainder of the day
and thereby took all the flavor from the thrills he
had found in &ldquo;Deep Blood Gulch.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>SMILES AND TEARS.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now there is no use in your arguing, Sadie&ndash;&ndash;I
love him and I have given him my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cousins were alone again speeding up
Fifth avenue in an automobile, a long-bodied foreign
car that had been put at the disposal of Mrs. Burton
by the New York agent of Mr. Hogg. The Omaha
suitor for the hand of the fair Helen had also thrown
in a red-headed French chauffeur, which is travelling
a bit in the matter of chauffeurs. But as he understood
only automobile English it was a delightful
arrangement for Helen and Sadie, and permitted
them absolute freedom of speech while riding behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had only known him longer, or had been introduced
to him differently,&rdquo; sighed Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t I known all about him for years?&rdquo;
protested Helen Burton. &ldquo;Of course, we were only
school girls when he made that wonderful rescue at
Narragansett Pier. Don&rsquo;t you remember how we
rushed down to the beach to see him, but got there
just too late? He had gone out to his yacht or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
something. Oh, it was just splendid, Sadie. And he
is so wonderfully modest about it. Why, when I reminded
him of his heroism he pretended to have forgotten
all about it. Just imagine Mr. Hogg forgetting
a thing like that! Do you know what Jabez
Hogg would do under similar circumstances, Sadie
Burton? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;d hire the biggest
hall in Omaha and reproduce the whole thing with
moving pictures as an advertisement for his beef canneries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young girl had worked herself into a passion
and was making savage little gestures with her
clenched fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I can&rsquo;t understand, Helen dear, is why
a man like Travers Gladwin should make such a mystery
of himself and try to avoid introducing you to
his friends. I am sure,&rdquo; persisted Sadie, despite the
gathering anger in her companion&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;that Aunt
Elvira would not object to him. You know she is
just crazy to break into the swim here in New York,
and the Gladwins are the very best of people. I
think it wouldn&rsquo;t take much to urge her even to
throw over Mr. Hogg for Gladwin, if you&rsquo;d only
let her take charge of the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; denied Helen hotly. &ldquo;Aunt
Elvira is bound on her solemn word of honor to Mr.
Hogg. She will fight for him to the last ditch, though
she knows I hate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Helen,&rdquo; said the younger girl,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
more soberly, &ldquo;that you are simply trying to make
yourself look at it that way? I know Mr. Hogg isn&rsquo;t
a pretty man and he has an awful name, but&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no but about it, Sadie Burton. I have
given my word to Travers Gladwin and I am going
to elope with him to-night. I packed my trunk this
morning and gave the porter $10 to take it secretly
to the Grand Central Station. Travers told me just
how to arrange it. Oh, there&rsquo;s his house now, Sadie;
the big white one on the corner. It just thrills me
to go by it. On our way back from Riverside Drive
we must stop there. I must leave word that auntie
insists on our going to the opera and that I won&rsquo;t be
able to get to him at the time we agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>do</i> wish something would turn up and
prevent it,&rdquo; cried Sadie, almost in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You horrid little thing!&rdquo; retorted Helen. &ldquo;It is
dreadful of you to talk like that when you know how
much I care for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I don&rsquo;t think you care for him,&rdquo; returned
Sadie with trembling lip. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something inside
of me that warns me. All this secrecy frightens
me. I can&rsquo;t understand why a man of Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s
wealth and social position would want to do
such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we both have tried to tell you,&rdquo; insisted
Helen, &ldquo;that there is an important business reason for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell what that reason was,&rdquo; persisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
the tearfully stubborn cousin. &ldquo;You admitted he
didn&rsquo;t give you any definite reason at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen Burton stamped her foot and bit her lip.
By this time the big touring car was gliding through
the East Drive of Central Park with the swift, noiseless
motion that denotes the highest development of
the modern motor vehicle. Fully a mile of the curving
roadway had slid under the wheels of the car before
Helen resumed the conversation with the sudden
outburst:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t doubt for an instant, Sadie, that he is
a gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His knowledge of painting and art is simply
wonderful. At that art sale, where we met, he knew
every painting at a glance. He didn&rsquo;t even have to
look for the signatures. You know, if it hadn&rsquo;t been
for him I would have bought that awful imitation
Fragonard and just thrown away two months of my
allowance. Sadie Burton, he is the cleverest man I
ever met. He has travelled everywhere and knows
everything, and I love him, I love him, I love him!&rdquo;
In proof of which the charming young woman burst
into tears and took refuge in her vast muff.</p>
<p>This sentimental explosion was too much for tender-hearted
Sadie. She gave way completely and
swore not to breathe another word in opposition to
the elopement. And as she felt her beloved cousin&rsquo;s
body shaken with sobs, she forced herself to go into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
ecstasies over Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s manly beauty and
god-like intellect. In her haste to soothe she went to
extravagant lengths and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he must have looked heavenly in his bathing
suit when he made that wonderful rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down fell Helen&rsquo;s muff with as much of a crash
as a muff could make and she turned upon her companion
the most profoundly shocked expression of a
bride-about-to-be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie,&rdquo; she reproved stiffly, &ldquo;you have gone far
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon it was Sadie&rsquo;s turn to seek the sanctuary
of tears.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>WHITNEY BARNES TELEPHONES TO THE RITZ.</h3>
</div>
<p>Glancing up into the solemn face of an unusually
good-looking young man who wore his silk hat at
a jaunty angle and whose every detail of attire suggested
that he was of that singularly blessed class who
toil not neither do they spin, Miss Mamie McCorkle,
public telephone operator in the tallest-but-one skyscraper
below the Fulton street dead line, expected to
be asked to look up some number in the telephone
book and be generously rewarded for the trifling exertion.
It wasn&rsquo;t any wonder, then, that she broke
the connections of two captains of industry and one
get-rich-quick millionaire when this was what she
got:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose, my dear young lady, that you had a
premonition&ndash;&ndash;a hunch, I might say&ndash;&ndash;that you were
destined this current day of the calendar week to meet
your Kismet in petticoats, wouldn&rsquo;t it make you feel
a bit hollow inside and justify you in taking your
first drink before your customary hour for absorbing
the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Usually a live wire at repartee, Mamie McCorkle
was stumped. With a captain of industry swearing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
in each ear and the get-rich-quick millionaire trying to
break in with his more artistic specialties in profanity,
she was for a moment frozen into silence. When she
did come to the surface, she set the captains of industry
down where they belonged, retorted upon
the get-rich-quick millionaire that he was no gentleman
and she hoped he would inform the manager she
said so and then raised her eyebrows at the interrogator
who leaned against her desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s an invitation to lunch, <i>No</i>! I&rsquo;m already
dated,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re trying to kid me, ring
off, the line is busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of which,&rdquo; said the young man, in the same
slow, sober voice, &ldquo;is sage counsel for the frivolous.
I am not. As you look like a very sensible young
woman, I put a sensible question to you. Perhaps my
language was vague. What I meant to convey was:
do you think I would be justified in taking a drink at
this early hour of the day to brace me for the ordeal
of falling in love with an unknown affinity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your language is personal,&rdquo; replied Miss McCorkle,
with a sarcastic laugh, &ldquo;my advice is to take
six drinks. I&rsquo;m in love with a chauffeur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the young man, brightly, &ldquo;and may
I ask if it was a sudden or a swift affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swift,&rdquo; snapped Miss McCorkle. &ldquo;He ran over
my stepmother, then brought her home. I let him
in. We were engaged next day. Here&rsquo;s the ring,
one and one-half carats, white!&ndash;&ndash;now, what number
do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks&ndash;&ndash;get me the Ritz-Carlton,
please, and don&rsquo;t break this ten-dollar bill. I hate
change, it spoils the set of one&rsquo;s pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Whitney Barnes squeezed himself into the
booth, Miss McCorkle squinted one eye at the crisp
bill he had laid before her and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than one way,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;of
being asked not to listen to dove talk, and I like this
method best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shrewd hello girl, however, had erred in the
case of Whitney Barnes, for this is the way his end
of the conversation in booth No. 7 ran:</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;This the Ritz? Yes. Kindly connect me with
Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;What Smith? Newest one you got. Forget the
first name. Thomas Smith, you say. Well, give me
Tom.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Hello, there, Trav&ndash;&ndash;that is, Tom, or do you
prefer Thomas?</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;What&rsquo;s that? Came in by way of Boston on a
Cunarder? What&rsquo;s all the row? Read you were
in Egypt, doing the pyramids.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Can&rsquo;t explain over the wire, eh. Hope it isn&rsquo;t
a divorce case; they&rsquo;re beastly.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Ought to know you better than that. Say, what&rsquo;s
the matter with your little angora?</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Be serious; it&rsquo;s no joking matter. Well, if it
wasn&rsquo;t serious how could I joke about it? You can&rsquo;t
joke about a joke.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m a fool! I wonder where I heard that before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Oh, yes&ndash;&ndash;a few minutes ago. My paternal
parent said the same thing.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Can I meet you at your house? Where is it?
I ought to know? I don&rsquo;t see why, you keep building
it over all the time and then go way and leave
it for two years at a stretch. Then when you do come
home you go and live under the&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Cut that out! My glory, but there is a mystery
here.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Certainly, I don&rsquo;t want to spoil everything.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Have I an engagement? I should say I have.
Just you call up Joshua Barnes and ask for the dope
on it&ndash;&ndash;a whole flock of engagements bunched into one
large contract, the biggest I ever tackled.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;No, I guess it won&rsquo;t prevent me from meeting
you. Not unless I happen to see her on the way
uptown.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Blessed if I know her any more than you. Wish
I did, but whoever she is she&rsquo;s got to be pretty awful
horrible nice.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Have I been drinking? No; but you better
have one ready for me. Seen any of the chaps at
the club? What&rsquo;s that? You gave it a wide berth.
This is beginning to sound like a detective novel or
a breach of promise case.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;You don&rsquo;t tell me. Really, I&rsquo;d never looked at
myself in that light before. Sure, I&rsquo;m stuck on myself.
Head over heels in love with myself. I&rsquo;m a
classy little party, I am, and you better make the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
best of me while I&rsquo;m here. Where am I going? Nowhere
in particular. Just going to merge my individuality,
bite a chunk out of an apple and get kicked
out of the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Now you&rsquo;re sure I&rsquo;m piffled. No such luck.
Trav&ndash;&ndash;that is, Mr. Smith&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Thomas Smith!
Shall I ask for Smith when I drop up at that little
marble palace of yours? No. Oh, Bateato will be
there if you happen to be delayed. How is the little
son of Nippon? Oh, that&rsquo;s good. Five sharp. Tata,
Smitty, old chap. By Jove, he&rsquo;s rung off with a
curse&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>OFFICER 666 ON PATROL.</h3>
</div>
<p>Michael Phelan had been two years on the force
and considered himself a very fly young man. He
had lost something of his romantic outline during the
six months he pounded the Third avenue pave past
two breweries and four saloons to a block, and it was
at his own request, made through his mother&rsquo;s second
cousin, District Leader McNaught, that he had
been provided with a saloonless beat on Fifth avenue.</p>
<p>A certain blue-eyed, raven-haired nursemaid, who
fed a tiny millionaire with a solid gold spoon and
trundled an imported perambulator along the east
walk of Central Park, may have had something to
do with Patrolman Phelan&rsquo;s choice of beat, but he
failed to mention the fact to his mother. He laid it
all on the breweries and the temptations they offered.</p>
<p>Humble as was Michael Phelan&rsquo;s station on the
force, he was already famous from the wooded wastes
of Staten Island to the wilds of the Bronx. Even
the graven-featured chief inspector permitted himself
to smile when the name of Michael Phelan was mentioned.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>He was a fresh, rosy-cheeked, greener-than-grass
probationary cop when fame came to him all in
one clap and awoke a thunderous roll of laughter
throughout the city.</p>
<p>It was his first detail on the lower east side in the
precinct commanded from the Eldridge street station.
The time was July and the day was a broiler. He
was sitting in the reserve room playing dominoes with
the doorman and mopping his forehead with a green
bandana when the captain sent for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phelan,&rdquo; said the captain shortly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lady
dead without a doctor at 311 Essex street, three flights
up, rear. They&rsquo;ve told the Coroner&rsquo;s Office, but all
the Coroners are busy. The corpse is a lone widow
lady with no kin, so you go up and take charge and
wait for the Coroner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officer 666 tipped his cap with military salute and
set out. Turning the corner into Essex street, he
met plain-clothes man Tim Feeney, who stopped him
and asked him where he was bound. Michael Phelan
explained and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tim, if you don&rsquo;t mind, will you give me a tip?
What do I do when I get up to that flat, and how
long will I have to wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wait, Mike,&rdquo; replied Tim Feeney,
&ldquo;till the Coroner gets good and ready to come. When
you get to the flat don&rsquo;t knock; walk right in. Then
sit down by the bed and wait. Be sure you keep the
door shut and let no soul in till the Coroner arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be powerful hot and I&rsquo;m perishing o&rsquo; thirst
now,&rdquo; said Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take off your coat,&rdquo; said Tim, &ldquo;and send a kid
for a can of beer. When you hear the Coroner comin&rsquo;
slip the can under the bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim Feeney went on his way with his hand over
his mouth.</p>
<p>Patrolman Phelan had missed the twinkle in Tim
Feeney&rsquo;s eye and a few minutes later found him sitting
beside a bed with his coat off and a foaming can
on the floor by his chair. On his way up the steep,
narrow staircases he had met a boy and sent him for
the liquid refreshment. He had instructed the lad
where to deliver the beer and had gone quietly in to
his unpleasant vigil.</p>
<p>The door he opened led directly into the bedroom.
He had glanced once at the bed and then looked away
with a shudder. Perspiration fairly cascaded down
his flaming cheeks as he tiptoed to a chair and placed
it beside the bed. He placed his chair at a slight angle
away from the bed and then fixed his eyes on the
opposite wall. When he heard the tread of the boy
in the hall he made a pussy-footed dash for the door,
took in the growler, shut the boy out and buried his
face in the froth. He was in better heart, but still
mighty uneasy when he wiped his mouth on the back
of his fist.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the flat a clock ticked dismally.
Through two small open windows puffed superheated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
gusts of air. The muffled clamor of many voices in
strange tongues sifted through the windows and walls,
but served only to increase the awful stillness in the
room. Despite his efforts to the contrary, Phelan
stole a glance at the bed, then looked away while his
heart stopped beating. There was a naked foot where
he had seen only a sheet before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe the wind blew it off,&rdquo; he tried to tell himself,
but something inside him rejected the explanation
and he felt an icy finger drawn up and down his
spine. Again he plunged his head into the capacious
can and succeeded in reviving his heart action.</p>
<p>More minutes of dreadful suspense passed. A
leaden silence had filled the sweltering room. Even
the voices of the tenements had died away to a
funereal murmur. Battle as he did with all his will,
Phelan&rsquo;s eyes were again drawn from their fixed gaze
upon the wall, and what he saw this time induced a
strangling sensation.</p>
<p>Three toes had distinctly wiggled.</p>
<p>He withdrew his eyes on the instant and his shaking
hand reached down for the can. His fingers had
barely touched it when an awful shriek rent the air.
The shriek came from the bed, and it was followed
by a second yell and then by a third.</p>
<p>Michael Phelan did not open the door as he passed
out. It was not a very strong door and it went down
like cardboard before the impact. The third shriek
awoke the echoes just as Officer 666 was coasting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
down the stairs on the seat of his departmental trousers.
His departmental coat and his departmental hat
were in no way connected with his precipitate transit.
A raging Polish woman brought these details of Michael&rsquo;s
uniform to the Eldridge street station a little
later. Likewise she prefered charges against Phelan
that come under the heading of &ldquo;conduct unbecoming
an officer and a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a tremendous trial, in the course of which
the Deputy Police Commissioner who sat in judgment
barely missed having a serious stroke. It was
adduced in evidence that Officer 666 had entered the
wrong flat, the Coroner&rsquo;s case being one flight up.</p>
<p>But while the whole town rocked with laughter
Michael Phelan failed to see the joke, and his hatred
of Precinct Detective Tim Feeney never cooled. That
he got off with a light sentence of one day&rsquo;s fine did
not in the least improve his humor. He knew he
was a marked man from that day, and it was all
his mother could do to urge him to stay on the
force.</p>
<p>In the course of time, however, the sting had worn
off and the young patrolman learned to smile again.
His hollow cheeks had filled out amazingly during the
period of the brewery beat and on that late autumn
day when he stepped into the pages of this narrative
he looked mighty good, not only to the raven-haired
Rosalind O&rsquo;Neill but to a host of other pretty nursemaids
who were wheeling their aristocratic little
charges up and down The Avenue.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></div>
<p>Nor was Michael Phelan at all unconscious of this
as he sauntered along the broad pavement and gracefully
twirled his baton. His chest jutted out like the
breast of a pouter pigeon and he wore the solemnly
self-conscious expression of a peacock on parade.</p>
<p>When he came to the great white square mansion
of Travers Gladwin, he paused and studied it shrewdly
with his eye. It was one of the most important
functions of his patrol to study the fronts of all unoccupied
dwellings and see that every window was
down and every door was closed. First he looked
into the areaway of the Gladwin home and then his
eye travelled up the wide balustraded stoop to the ornamental
bronze doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this!&rdquo; he gasped in astonishment. &ldquo;Sure,
I read in the papers on&rsquo;y this morning that Travers
Gladwin was in Agypt. &rsquo;Tis a bold thafe who&rsquo;ll go
in the front door in broad day, so here&rsquo;s where Mary
Phelan&rsquo;s son makes the grand pinch he&rsquo;s been dreamin&rsquo;
on this six months back and gets his picture in the
papers.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>THE LITTLE BROWN JAP.</h3>
</div>
<p>Patrolman Phelan wrapped his sinewy fist
about the handle of his club with a vicious grip as he
proceeded cautiously up the steps. The heavy bronze
door had been left ajar, and he squeezed through
without opening it further, then paused in the vestibule
and listened. What he heard seemed no more
than the tread of a spider, and the thought rushed
into his head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis one of that felt-soled kind. &rsquo;Tis tip-toes for
Phelan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had noted that even the inside door was open,
and he swiftly divined from this that the thief had
left it open for his own convenience or for some other
purpose connected with the mysteries of burglar
alarms. Inch by inch the policeman moved across the
vestibule and wriggled through the door into the
richly carpeted hallway.</p>
<p>It was with a distinct sense of relief that he felt
his heavy boots sink noiselessly into the deep ply of
a precious Daghestan rug. One of Phelan&rsquo;s boots
had a bad creak in it, and he knew that the master
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
crook who would attempt such a robbery as this would
have an acute sense of hearing.</p>
<p>It was dark as a pocket down the stretch of the
heavily curtained foyer, save for a meagre shaft of
light that came through a slightly parted pair of porti&egrave;res
to the left and not a dozen feet from where he
stood. He strained his ear toward this shaft of light
until there came an unmistakable swish of sound,
whereupon he moved forward in short, gliding steps.</p>
<p>When he reached the break in the porti&egrave;res and
looked in he was astonished to see a short little man
with shiny black hair deftly removing the linen covers
from chairs and tables and statuary. The little
man had his back to Phelan as the policeman stepped
inside, but he turned in a flash and confronted the intruder
with the peculiar glazed grimness of the Japanese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what matter?&rdquo; ripped out the little Jap,
without moving a muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I come to find out,&rdquo; retorted Phelan,
with accusing severity of tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you get in here?&rdquo; retorted the Jap in the
same sharp, emotionless tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw ye snakin&rsquo; in an&rsquo; ye didn&rsquo;t latch the door
after yez,&rdquo; blurted Phelan, taking a step nearer the
Jap and still watching him with profound suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you want?&rdquo; asked the Jap with a slight
tremor of apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Information!&rdquo; cried Phelan. &ldquo;What are yez
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
doin&rsquo; in here?&rdquo; Phelan&rsquo;s eye swept the room for
some evidence of an attempt to despoil. Though he
saw none he did not relinquish his attitude of suspicion.
The Jap seemed about to speak and then
stopped. As Phelan continued to glower at him, he
snapped out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I no can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Triumph blazed in Phelan&rsquo;s eyes. Now he was sure
he had a thief and he determined to handle the situation
with all the majesty of his official person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So yez can&rsquo;t tell what yez&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; in this house,&rdquo;
he said with fine sarcasm.</p>
<p>The Jap shook his head emphatically and returned
a positive, &ldquo;No tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan balanced his club for a moment and strode
toward the Jap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yez better come with me,&rdquo; he said through compressed
lips.</p>
<p>The Jap started back with a frightened exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no take me to jail?&rdquo; he uttered, while his
yellow features twitched with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a minute,&rdquo; replied the elated officer, &ldquo;if yez
don&rsquo;t tell me what yez&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; here. I&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo;
out for this place while Mr. Gladwin was in foreign
parts, and&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Mr. Gladwin?&rdquo; broke in the Jap, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t never seen him,&rdquo; said Phelan, &ldquo;but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
know this is his house an&rsquo; I been keepin&rsquo; my eye on
it fer him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;he my boss!&rdquo; and the Jap grinned
from ear to ear.</p>
<p>This solution of the mystery never entered the
policeman&rsquo;s head and he resented the surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do yez mean yez&rsquo;re his valley?&rdquo; he asked vindictively,
refusing to relinquish his suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees!&rdquo; and again the Jap grinned.</p>
<p>Phelan read the grin as a distinct insult to his intelligence
and he pounced upon the little brown man
in an even more caustic tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If yez&rsquo;re are Mr. Gladwin&rsquo;s valley, what are ye
doin&rsquo; here an&rsquo; him thousands o&rsquo; miles away across
the ocean in Agypt an&rsquo; Jerusalem an&rsquo; the like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it was Phelan&rsquo;s turn to grin as he saw the
Jap shrink and turn upon him a pair of wildly alarmed
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come! Come! I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; fer an answer,&rdquo; The
cat had his mouse backed into a corner and mentally
licked his chops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I no can tell,&rdquo; stammered the Jap, desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; ripped out Officer 666, grabbing
the Jap by the shoulder and yanking him toward the
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;wait!&rdquo; gasped the struggling prisoner.
&ldquo;You no say if I tell you, plees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me first,&rdquo; grunted Phelan, releasing his grip.</p>
<p>The Jap ducked his head in every direction as if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
fearful that the walls had ears, then said in an impressive
whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boss&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misther Gladwin home! Here in New York!&rdquo;
There was both incredulity and amazement in Phelan&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees!&rdquo; bleated the Jap and his grin returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you say so before?&rdquo; said Phelan
angrily, at which the fidgety little brown son of Nippon
hastened to explain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one should know. He come all in much secret.
He go boat to Boston. No use name. No one
know he Mr. Gladwin. He say, &lsquo;Bateato&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;me Bateato&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Bateato,&rsquo;
he say, &lsquo;no tell I come home&ndash;&ndash;sure,&rsquo;
he say, and Bateato he no tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officer Phelan yielded to the grip of the mystery
and his attitude toward the Jap changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want to snake home that away fer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I no know,&rdquo; nodded Bateato.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yez no know, eh? Well, is he comin&rsquo; here?&ndash;&ndash;do
yez no know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He tell me&ndash;&ndash;come here and wait&ndash;&ndash;feex thees
room&ndash;&ndash;he come here or telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The straightforward manner of the little Jap had
almost completely disarmed the policeman&rsquo;s suspicion,
but he surrendered reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he give yez a key to get in here?&rdquo; Phelan
fired as his last shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees&ndash;&ndash;he give me all bunch keys&ndash;&ndash;look!&rdquo; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
Bateato produced a gold key ring with a gold tag
and a number of keys attached. Phelan examined it
and read aloud the name Travers Gladwin engraved
on the tag. Handing them back to the Jap, he addressed
him impressively, gesturing his emphasis with
his baton:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess yez&rsquo;re all right, but I&rsquo;ll have me eye on
yez from the outside, mind that&ndash;&ndash;and if yez&rsquo;re foolin&rsquo;
me or tryin&rsquo; to get away with anythin&rsquo;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Phelan snapped his lips together and with a mighty
lunge plucked an imaginary prisoner out of the atmosphere
and shook it ferociously. Then stepping back
to the doorway he shut one eye with a fierce wink and
jerked out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are yez wise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The profound pantomime was too much for Bateato,
who stared after the vanishing officer in open-mouthed
amazement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>ART, MYSTERY AND LOVE.</h3>
</div>
<p>The little Jap was still posed in an attitude of bewilderment
as the two outside doors slammed and
Officer 666 went down the front steps to resume the
tread of his beat and the breaking of fragile hearts.</p>
<p>When he did emerge from his trance he returned
to the task of getting the great room in order with
the same snappy energy he had displayed when the
uniformed minion of the law broke in upon him. He
had removed the covers from the chairs and was dusting
off a great carved chest that stood against the
wall to the right of the doorway when the door bell
rang. Bateato jumped and then waited for a second
ring. Stepping warily out into the hallway, he looked
to see if it was the grim official in blue and buttons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;No more police,&rdquo; and he
shot to the door and opened it for that debonnair
young gentleman who was one day to inherit the mustard
millions of Old Grim Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there, Bateato,&rdquo; Whitney Barnes greeted
the little Jap cordially. &ldquo;Did your master show up
yet?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He no come,&rdquo; grinned Bateato, shutting the door
and leading the way into the room he had been preparing
for his master&rsquo;s arrival. As Whitney Barnes
stepped into the room the Jap asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Scuse me, Mr. Barnes&ndash;&ndash;you see Mr. Gladwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor his double, Thomas Smith of the Ritz;
but he asked me to meet him here at 5 o&rsquo;clock, Bateato.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees sair!&rdquo; lisped the Jap, with a bob of the head;
then dived back to his occupation of making the long
deserted room look presentable.</p>
<p>As Bateato followed his master&rsquo;s friend into the
room he switched on the full glare of electric lights
that depended from the ceiling or blazed through
the shades of many lamps. Whitney Barnes blinked
for a moment, and then started as his gaze was directed
to the walls hung with masterpieces.</p>
<p>The work of Rubens, Rembrandt, Coret, Meissonier,
Lely, Cazzin, Vegas, Fragonard, Reynolds and
a score others of the world&rsquo;s greatest masters leaped
across his vision as he turned from wall to wall, revolving
on his heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that
Travers went in for this sort of thing. He certainly
is the secretive little oyster when he wants to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still studying the portraits and landscapes and allegorical
groups, he voiced to Bateato a sudden thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Bateato, do you know what it was
that brought your master back in this strange fashion
and the reason for all this secrecy?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sair,&rdquo; responded the Jap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s damned peculiar!&rdquo; muttered the young
man to himself, and proceeded on a tour about the
room to examine more closely its wealth of art treasure.
He had been engaged in this way about five
minutes when the door bell rang and Bateato cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here Mr. Gladwin now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that Bateato?&rdquo; quizzed the
young man absently, his attention being gripped by
a stunning aphrodite rising from the sea in a glory
of nudity and rainbows.</p>
<p>The Jap paused a second on his way to the door,
and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause no one know he home but Mr. Barnes.
Thees house close up much long time and Mr. Gladwin
make papers say he in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same breath in which he maximed this volley
of words the little Jap projectiled himself from
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His deductions are marvellous,&rdquo; said Whitney
Barnes, solemnly addressing a bronze bust of Philip
of Macedon. He turned in time to meet the brisk
entrance of Travers Gladwin, alias Thomas Smith of
the Ritz.</p>
<p>The two shook hands warmly and looked into each
other&rsquo;s faces with quizzical smiles. They were about
of an age, both unusually good looking and bearing
themselves with that breezy, confident manner that
is characteristic of young men who have been coddled
in swan&rsquo;s-down all their lives.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, well, Travers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Whitney, old boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The greeting sprang from their lips simultaneously,
and after he had tossed his hat and cane to his
valet Travers Gladwin continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t expect to see me so soon, did you, old
scout?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say I didn&rsquo;t. Why, when I got that telegram
of yours to call up Thomas Smith at the Ritz
it certainly was some jar to my delicate nervous system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin laughed and rubbed his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it, though?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Gave you a real
thrill, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exact and specific&ndash;&ndash;a real thrill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re lucky&ndash;&ndash;a surprise and a thrill. I&rsquo;d
give anything for a real surprise&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve hunted this
little planet&rsquo;s four corners for one and failed to
connect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t achieve &rsquo;em you seem to be in the
business of manufacturing &rsquo;em. Come along now,
what&rsquo;s all this thundering mystery. I&rsquo;m shot to pieces
with curiosity. What&rsquo;s happened to make you come
home like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watkins!&rdquo; replied Travers Gladwin curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watkins! What Watkins? Who&rsquo;s Watkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watkins is my man&ndash;&ndash;I mean, Watkins was my
man before I found out that he was systematically
robbing me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember now. A jolly good servant,
though. So he robbed you, did he? But they all
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they don&rsquo;t always get found out&ndash;&ndash;caught
with the goods, as the police say. I caught
Watkins with the goods and sacked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that you came kiting
home from the pyramids and the lovely Sahara desert
just because this chap Watkins was dishonest?&rdquo; said
Whitney Barnes, in tones of incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Whitney,&rdquo; replied Gladwin, dropping into a
chair and puckering his forehead with a frown. &ldquo;Watkins
was only the start of it. I got rid of him six
months ago. But while I was on my way to Egypt
I learned that Watkins and my lawyer had been in
some sort of a secret correspondence before I gave
Watkins the bounce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What lawyer? Not &lsquo;Old Reliable&rsquo; Forbes? Why,
I thought he wore a certified halo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I, but I&rsquo;ve got news to the contrary, and
you know he has charge of everything for me&ndash;&ndash;keeps
all my securities&ndash;&ndash;has a power of attorney&ndash;&ndash;signs
checks and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds bad,&rdquo; said Whitney Barnes, sympathetically.
&ldquo;The old saint could come pretty close to
ruining you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve hit it,&rdquo; assented Gladwin. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve
come home to investigate&ndash;&ndash;sleuthing expedition, you
might say. Didn&rsquo;t want him to hear I was coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
and climb out. Now you&rsquo;ve got the answer to the
gumshoe riddle. My plan is to lie low and have you
look him up. Nothing else on foot, Whitney?
Haven&rsquo;t gone into mustard or Wall street, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Whitney Barnes&rsquo;s turn to construct a frown
and take on an air of intense seriousness, while his
friend smiled at him, thinking it was one of his humorous
moods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I have anything definite on foot,&rdquo; said
Barnes slowly, &ldquo;but the pater has given me a rather
important commission to fulfil, though not exactly
in mustard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Travers Gladwin with a trace
of annoyance, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better call on somebody else. I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; broke in Whitney Barnes.
&ldquo;It may fit right in with my plans. It&rsquo;ll keep me circulating
round a lot and that&rsquo;s just what I want&ndash;&ndash;that
and what Bateato is bringing,&rdquo; as the little
brown man entered the room on the run, bearing
a silver tray, decanter and glasses.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>THE CURSE OF MILLIONS.</h3>
</div>
<p>As Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s valet filled the tall, slim
glasses with the fizzing amber-colored fluid which constitutes
the great American highball, the two friends
stretched their legs and lost themselves for a few moments
in aimless reverie. Bateato looked from one
to the other, puzzled by their seriousness. He clinked
the glasses to rouse them and glided from the room.
Whitney Barnes was the first to look up and shake
himself free of the sober spell that gripped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce made you skip abroad in such a
hurry, Travers?&rdquo; he asked, reaching for his glass.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin sat up with a start, pulled a
lugubrious smile and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bored to death&ndash;&ndash;nothing interested me&ndash;&ndash;living the
most commonplace, humdrum, unromantic existence
imaginable. Teas and dances, dances and teas, clubs
and theatres, theatres and clubs, motors and yachts,
yachts and motors. It was horrible, and I can&rsquo;t help
thinking it was all my dear old governor&rsquo;s fault. He
had no consideration for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He left you a tidy lot of millions,&rdquo; drawled
Whitney Barnes.</p>
<p>Young Gladwin drained his glass, jumped to his
feet and began to pace the room, hands deep in his
trousers pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just it!&rdquo; he flung out. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d left me
nothing but a shilling or two there&rsquo;d be some joy
in living. I&rsquo;d have had to buckle down. There&rsquo;s
variety, interest, pleasure in having to make your
own way in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes laughed mockingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go out and tell that to the toiling masses,&rdquo; he
chuckled, &ldquo;and listen to them give you the ha-ha.
You&rsquo;re in a bad way, old chap&ndash;&ndash;better see a brain
specialist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m in a bad way,&rdquo; Gladwin ran on fiercely,
&ldquo;but doctors can&rsquo;t do me any good. It was all
right while I was a frolicking lamb, but after I got
over the age of thinking myself a devil of a fellow
things began to grow tame. I was romantic, sentimental&ndash;&ndash;wanted
to fall in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you interest me,&rdquo; Whitney Barnes interjected,
stiffening to attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I wanted to fall in love, Whitney, but I
couldn&rsquo;t get it out of my head that every girl I met
had her eye on my fortune and not on me. And if it
wasn&rsquo;t the girl it was her mother, and mothers, that
is mothers-in-law-to-be or mothers-that-want-to-be-in-law
or&ndash;&ndash;what the deuce do I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I get you, Steve&ndash;&ndash;they&rsquo;re awful. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I gave it up&ndash;&ndash;the hunt for the right girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dickens you say! I wish you hadn&rsquo;t told me
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I went in for art,&rdquo; Gladwin raced on, carried
breathlessly on the tide of his emotions and ignoring
his friend&rsquo;s observations. &ldquo;I went in for these things
on the walls, statuary, ceramics, rugs, and tapestries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a mighty fine collection,&rdquo; struck in
Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I soon got tired of art&ndash;&ndash;I still hungered
for romance. I went abroad to find it. I said to myself,
&lsquo;If there&rsquo;s a real thrill anywhere on this earth
for a poor millionaire, I&rsquo;ll try and find it&ndash;&ndash;make a
thorough search. It wasn&rsquo;t any use. Every country
I went to was the same. All I could find were things
my money could buy and all those things have long
ceased to interest me. There was only once in all
the years I&rsquo;ve been craving a romance&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up there, Travers Gladwin, you&rsquo;re talking
like Methusaleh. You&rsquo;ve been of age only a few
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems centuries, but as I started to say&ndash;&ndash;there
was only once. Two years ago in a trolley car, right
here in the midst of this heartless city. Seated opposite
me was a girl&ndash;&ndash;a blonde&ndash;&ndash;most beautiful hair
you ever saw. No use my trying to describe her
eyes, clearest, bluest and keep right on piling up the
superlatives&ndash;&ndash;peaches and cream complexion with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
transparent down on it, dimples and all that sort of
thing. You know the kind&ndash;&ndash;a goddess every inch
of her. Her clothes were poor and I knew by that
she was honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man paused and gazed rapturously
into space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on; go on,&rdquo; urged Barnes. &ldquo;Poor but honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught her eye once and my heart thumped&ndash;&ndash;could
feel it beating against my cigarette case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the real soul-mate stuff; go on!&rdquo; cried
Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she got off at one of the big shops. I followed.
She went in one of the employees&rsquo; entrances.
She worked there&ndash;&ndash;I could see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you wait for her to go out to lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I had an engagement. Next day I caught
that same car, but she was not on it. I kept on trying
and the fourth day she was on the car, looking lovelier
than ever. When she got off the car I got off.
I stepped up and raised my hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Forgive me for approaching you in this impertinent
manner,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but I would like to introduce
myself,&rsquo; and I handed her my card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youthful head of the house of Gladwin
stopped abruptly and slid listlessly into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I demand to hear what she replied,&rdquo; insisted
Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just what she said,&rdquo; mused Gladwin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
&ldquo;though that was bad enough, but it was the way
she said it. These were her exact words, &lsquo;Go on,
yer fresh slob, an&rsquo; sneak yer biscuits!&rsquo; How does
that suit you for exploding a romance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blown to powder and bits,&rdquo; murmured Whitney
Barnes, sombrely. &ldquo;Sorry you told me this&ndash;&ndash;never
mind why&ndash;&ndash;but there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve been wanting
to ask you for a long time: How about that girl you
rescued from drowning four years ago? I remember
it made you quite famous at the time. According to
all standards of romance, you should have married
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin looked up with a wry smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see the lady?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Wasn&rsquo;t she pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a brunette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fancy brunettes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a dark brunette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, from Africa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was tough luck!&rdquo; exclaimed Barnes without
cracking a smile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>THE HEARTBEATS OF MR. HOGG.</h3>
</div>
<p>In a magnificently furnished apartment on Madison
avenue, which Mrs. Elvira Burton had rented for
New York&rsquo;s winter season, that augustly beautiful or
beautifully august lady sat writing. I may say that
she was writing grimly and that there was Jovian determination
stamped upon her high, broad forehead
and indented at the corners of her tense lips.</p>
<p>She had just returned from a consultation with two
matrons of the same stern fibre as herself. No group
of gray-bearded physicians had ever weighed the
fate of a patient with more attention to pathological
detail than had Mrs. Burton and her two friends
weighed the fate of Helen Burton, but whereas it
rarely happens that pork is prescribed in a delicate
case, the result of that petticoated conclave was that
Hogg was prescribed for the flower-like ward of the
leader of Omaha&rsquo;s socially elect.</p>
<p>While Mrs. Burton had done most of the talking,
her two friends who had broken into New York&rsquo;s
next-to-the-top layer of society by means of the hyphens
with which they coupled the names of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
first and second husbands; her two friends, I say,
had managed to wedge in a word or two&ndash;&ndash;all in favor
of Jabez Hogg.</p>
<p>The guardian of the two prettiest girls who had
ever debutanted in the Nebraska metropolis emerged
from that conference on fire with resolve. She would
marry Helen to Mr. Hogg, thus link together
the Hogg and Burton millions and thereby create an
alliance that would take its place beside any in the
country in the matter of bank account.</p>
<p>So confident was she of the power of her will that
she did not even remove her wraps before she sat
down to answer Jabez Hogg&rsquo;s letter. Nor did she
bother to ask her maid if Helen and Sadie had returned
from their ride. She did not care to discuss the matter
with them. She had decided. It remained only
for weaker wills to yield.</p>
<p>Beginning with a regal flourish of the pen, she
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>My Dear Mr. Hogg</span>: I received this morning
your courteous note, begging me to persuade Helen
to give you a final answer. It pains me deeply that
you should suffer so from her neglect&ndash;&ndash;after all your
kindness. I trust that you will forgive it on the
score of her youth. She is very young and her head
has been turned with too much flattery. She shall be
yours&ndash;&ndash;that I can promise you. When you come on
for your annual slaughter-house directors&rsquo; meeting
you may bring the ring. I have already given the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
order for the engraving of the engagement announcements,
and I will arrange to give a reception and
dance for Helen at the Plaza. I do not know how
to thank you for putting your French car at our disposal.
It has saved us a great deal of annoyance
and bother. Helen has spoken often of your thoughtfulness&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Burton stayed her flying pen and grimly read
the last sentence aloud. It was not the strict truth,
as she was writing it. Helen had spoken frequently
of the convenience of the car, but she had added that
she could never ride in it without feeling that she was
going to run over a pig and hear it squeal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton did not waver for more than an instant,
however. In a way of speaking she gripped
her conscience by the neck, strangled it, and threw it
into the discard. Then she continued with her letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have been looking at houses on the avenue and
would suggest that you try and negotiate for the
Gladwin mansion. The owner lives abroad, and
while it is not in the market I am advised that the
young man would be glad to get rid of it. He is
said to be living a fast life in Paris, and while he was
left a great fortune he would probably be glad to get
the ready money. I know of no finer home in New
York for you to settle down in after your honeymoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanking you again for your constant thoughtfulness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
and hoping that you will now banish every doubt
from your mind, I remain,</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Faithfully yours,<span class='rindent8'>&nbsp;</span><br />
&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Elvira Burton</span>.&rdquo;<span class='rindent2'>&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The smile with which Mrs. Burton sealed this letter
and delivered it to her maid was more than a
smile of triumph. It was a positively fiendish smile
of victory.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>GAINSBOROUGH &ldquo;BLUE BOY.&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>Having discounted the romantic element of his
thrilling rescue at Narragansett Pier, Travers Gladwin
fell into a moody silence. The more volatile
Barnes felt the influence and strove to fight it off.
While he, too, had been set upon the trail of romance
at the behest of his father, he felt it was too early
to indulge in pessimistic reveries, so he groped for another
subject with which to revive the interest of his
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Travers,&rdquo; he led off, rising from his chair
and indicating the walls with a sweep of his hand,
&ldquo;as I remarked before, you&rsquo;ve got a wonderful collection
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; assented the young millionaire without animation,
&ldquo;but, as <i>I</i> said before, I soon got tired of it.
The pastime of collecting pictures became a burden,
and I was glad to get abroad and forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Barnes, &ldquo;I guess the only thing for
you to do is to go to work at something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; grumbled Gladwin, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the
incentive? I don&rsquo;t want any more money&ndash;&ndash;what I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
have now is the biggest sort of a nuisance. Just see
the trouble I&rsquo;m in for with my lawyer and that
man Watkins, though to tell you the truth I am beginning
to enjoy the novelty of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man got up and assumed a more lively
expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Whitney,&rdquo; he ran on, &ldquo;this travelling
incognito isn&rsquo;t half bad. They are really getting
suspicious of me at the Ritz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely some one there ought to know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul! It was opened while I was abroad.
You know I registered as Thomas Smith and I even
took a chance and went down into the grill room
for lunch. And there, Whitney,&rdquo; cried Gladwin with
an explosive burst of enthusiasm, &ldquo;I nearly got a
thrill&ndash;&ndash;another one like that on the trolley car.
The last place you&rsquo;d expect it, too, in the midst of stiff
formality and waiters so cold and haughty they might
have risen from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this was the ravishing girl at the cigar
counter?&rdquo; said Barnes, ironically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort&ndash;&ndash;never smoked a cigar in her
life&ndash;&ndash;I mean, that is, well, something entirely different.
But she was a beauty! Golden bronze hair&ndash;&ndash;Titian
never painted anything like it; the bluest
eyes behind the most wonderful dark lashes, creamy
white skin&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you followed her to a cloak factory, where
you found&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Please wait till I finish, Whitney. I followed
her nowhere, though she interested me tremendously.
I wish you could have seen her eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Particularly the grapefruit. By Jove, Barnes,
that girl certainly loves grapefruit! It was fascinating.
I couldn&rsquo;t keep my eyes off of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did she notice you?&rdquo; quizzed Barnes, raising
his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was too busy,&rdquo; came the gloomy rejoinder.
&ldquo;I watched her steadily, fairly bored her with my
eyes&ndash;&ndash;tried to will her to look at me. They say you
can do that, you know&ndash;&ndash;mental telepathy, projecting
thought waves or something of the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo; cried Barnes, impatiently. &ldquo;I tried
that on a dog once and I&rsquo;ve got the scar yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell you, Whitney, it almost worked. After
a time her eyelids began to flutter and the roses in
her cheeks bloomed darker. But just as I felt sure
she would look up and see me&ndash;&ndash;splash! the grapefruit
hit her in the eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; ejaculated Whitney Barnes, wheeling
open-mouthed and facing his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The juice, I mean,&rdquo; Gladwin laughed ruefully,
&ldquo;and, of course, the spell was broken. She never
looked again. Dash it all, there&rsquo;s some sort of a
lemon in all my romances!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly do play in tough luck,&rdquo; sympathized
Barnes. &ldquo;I can see that you need bucking up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
and I think I&rsquo;ve got the right kind of remedy for
you. Wait, I&rsquo;ll call Bateato.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes stepped briskly across the room
and pressed a button. In a twinkling the little Jap
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bateato,&rdquo; said Barnes, &ldquo;has your master any hunting
clothes at the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair!&rdquo; responded the Jap. &ldquo;Plenty hotel&ndash;&ndash;plenty
house. We no time pack all clothes&ndash;&ndash;go sail
too quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty here&ndash;&ndash;splendid!&rdquo; enthused Barnes. &ldquo;Pack
a bag for him, Bateato, this instant&ndash;&ndash;enough things
to last a couple of weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; cut in Gladwin. &ldquo;What are you
going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; retorted Barnes, importantly;
&ldquo;you do as I say, Bateato&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to show your
master some excitement. He&rsquo;ll never get it here in
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair! I pack him queeck,&rdquo; and Bateato vanished
noiselessly, seemingly to shoot through the doorway
and up the broad staircase as if sucked up a flue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see here&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;objected Travers Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word now,&rdquo; his friend choked him off. &ldquo;If
you don&rsquo;t like it you don&rsquo;t have to stay, but I&rsquo;m going
to take you in hand and show you a time you&rsquo;re not
used to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s argue about it,&rdquo; said Barnes, lightly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
&ldquo;You called me in here to take charge of things and
I&rsquo;m taking charge. Just to change the subject, tell
me something about your paintings. This one, for
instance&ndash;&ndash;who is that haughty looking old chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes had planted himself with legs
spread wide apart in front of one of the largest portraits
in the room, a life-size painting of an aristocratic
looking old man who seemed on the point of
strangling in his stock.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin turned to the painting and said
with an unmistakable note of pride:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The original Gladwin, my great-grandfather.
Painted more than a hundred years ago by Gilbert
Stuart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you beat me, Travers&ndash;&ndash;the original Barnes
hadn&rsquo;t discovered mustard a hundred years ago. But
I say, here&rsquo;s a Gainsborough, &lsquo;The Blue Boy.&rsquo; By
George! that&rsquo;s a stunner! Worth a small fortune,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes had crossed the room and stood
before the most striking looking portrait in the collection,
a tall, handsome boy in a vividly blue costume of
the Gainsborough period.</p>
<p>The owner of &ldquo;The Blue Boy&rdquo; turned around, cast
a fleeting glimpse at the portrait and turned away
with a peculiar grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suppose wrong, Whitney,&rdquo; he said, shortly.
&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;so&ndash;&ndash;horribly&ndash;&ndash;valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! A big painting like that, by a chap famous
enough to have a hat named after him.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That was just about the way it struck me at first,&rdquo;
answered Gladwin, &ldquo;so I begged two old gentlemen
in London to let me have it. Persuaded them to part
with it for a mere five hundred pounds, on condition&ndash;&ndash;close
attention, Whitney&ndash;&ndash;that I keep the matter
a secret. I was delighted with my bargain&ndash;&ndash;until I
saw <i>the original</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The original?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah ha! the original. It was quite a shock for me
to come face to face with that and realize that my
&lsquo;Blue Boy&rsquo; had a streak of yellow in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds exciting,&rdquo; cried Barnes. &ldquo;What did
you do? Put the case in the hands of the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; denied Gladwin emphatically. &ldquo;That
would have given the public a fine laugh. It deceived
me, so I hung it up there to deceive others. It
got you, you see. But you are the only one I&rsquo;ve let
into the secret&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t repeat it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; promised Barnes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be too much
of a lark to hear others rave over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; acknowledged the bitten collector,
curtly.</p>
<p>Barnes wandered from &ldquo;The Blue Boy&rdquo; and signalled
out another painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who painted this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Veber&ndash;&ndash;but do you know, Whitney, the
more I think of it&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s something about that
grapefruit girl, something gripping that&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like these two,&rdquo; commented Barnes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something different about her&ndash;&ndash;something&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this by?&rdquo; inquired Barnes, lost in admiration
of a Meissonier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blonde&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very young, and I know her smile&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Travers, what are these two worth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin volplaned to earth, climbed out of his
sky chariot and was back in the midst of his art treasures
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said hastily. &ldquo;Which
two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes pointed to two of the smaller pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess,&rdquo; suggested his host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Multiply it by ten&ndash;&ndash;then add something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, really! That one on the left is a Rembrandt!
and the other is a Corot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word; they&rsquo;re corkers, eh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when you know who painted them, and if
you happen to have the eye of a connoisseur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what in creation is this?&rdquo; exclaimed Barnes,
as he stumbled against the great ornamental chest
which stood against the wall just beneath the Rembrandt
and Corot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s get the exhibition over,&rdquo; said Gladwin,
peevishly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a treasure chest. Cost me a
barrel&ndash;&ndash;picked it up in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You never picked it up in your life,&rdquo; retorted
Barnes, grasping the great metal bound chest and
striving vainly to lift it. &ldquo;Anything in it?&rdquo; he asked,
lifting the lid and answering himself in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the whole collection worth?&rdquo; asked
Barnes, as he returned to where his friend was standing,
gazing ruefully at &ldquo;The Blue Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, half a million or more. I really never kept
track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a million! And you go abroad and leave all
these things unguarded? You certainly are fond of
taking chances. It&rsquo;s a marvel they haven&rsquo;t been
stolen before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Gladwin. &ldquo;I have a burglar
alarm set here, and I&rsquo;ll wager there aren&rsquo;t half a
dozen persons who know the Gladwin collection is
hung in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same&ndash;&ndash;but I say, Travers, there&rsquo;s the
door bell. Were you expecting anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin glanced about him nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;On the contrary, I didn&rsquo;t
wish&ndash;&ndash;what the deuce does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means some one is at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>APPROACHING A WORLD OF MYSTERY.</h3>
</div>
<p>Gaston Brielle, the strawberry blonde French
chauffeur who piloted the big, luxurious motor car
Jabez Hogg of Omaha had placed at the service of
Mrs. Elvira Burton and her two charming young
nieces, did not have his mind entirely concentrated
upon manipulating the wheel and throttle of the
car as he swung around Grant&rsquo;s Tomb and sped southward
down the Drive. While his knowledge of English
was confined to a few expletives of a profane
nature and the mystic jargon of the garage, he was
nevertheless thrilled by the belief that the two mademoiselles
behind him were plotting some mysterious
enterprise.</p>
<p>From time to time they had unconsciously dropped
their voices to the low tones commonly used by conspirators,
or at least that was the way Gaston had
sensed it. Along the silent roads of Central Park
and Riverside Drive, where even the taxis seemed to
employ their mufflers and to resort less frequently to
the warning racket of their exhausts, the Frenchman
had been straining his ears to listen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<p>He had heard on two occasions what he divined as
a manifest sob, first when the emotional Sadie gave
way to tears and again when Helen was aggravated
to a petulant outburst of grief.</p>
<p>Later when he heard bright laughter and gay exclamations
he could hardly believe his ears. He was
profoundly troubled and completely bewildered&ndash;&ndash;a
dangerous state of mind for a man who has the power
of seventy horses under the pressure of his thumb.</p>
<p>Nor was his mental turmoil in the least alleviated
when, having turned south and being on the point of
coasting down a precipitous hill he felt a touch on
his shoulder and heard the elder of his two pretty
passengers command him in worse French than his
own poor English to go slow when he turned into
Fifth avenue again and be prepared to stop.</p>
<p>Gaston knew that this was in direct violation of
his orders from Mrs. Burton, but when he saw a yellow-backed
bill flutter down over his shoulder his
quick intelligence blazed with understanding. His
first groping suspicions had been justified. There was
romance in the wind. Steering easily with one hand,
Gaston deftly seized the bill and caused it to vanish
somewhere in his great fur coat.</p>
<p>Sadie Burton had been horror-stricken at this bold
proffer of a bribe. Likewise she was alarmed that
Helen should put so much trust in Gaston, who
seemed to be in mortal terror of her aunt and to
quake all through his body when he listened to her
commands.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>As Helen sank back beside her, after letting fall
the bribe, the agitated Sadie whispered tremulously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you can trust him, Helen? If he
should tell Auntie El she would surely make you a
prisoner. You will never get a chance to leave her
side at the opera to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gaston is a Frenchman, my dear,&rdquo; laughed Helen,
confidently, &ldquo;and most Frenchmen&ndash;&ndash;even chauffeurs,
I am sure&ndash;&ndash;would cut their hearts out before they
would oppose a barrier to the course of true love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Helen&rsquo;s gayety did not communicate itself to
Sadie. That shy miss trembled apprehensively as
she sought to picture herself in Helen&rsquo;s place&ndash;&ndash;on the
verge of an elopement. Not that such a prospect
did not have its alluring thrill even to such a shrinking
maiden as the violet-eyed Sadie, but her fear of
her aunt seemed to crush and obliterate these titillating
sensations. As the car shot through Seventy-second
street and headed for the entrance to the West
Drive of Central Park, she ventured another word
of caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to send a messenger to Mr.
Gladwin&rsquo;s house, Helen? Suppose we should run
into somebody there who knew auntie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ridiculously little fraid-cat,&rdquo; Helen caught
her up. &ldquo;Of course there&rsquo;ll be nobody there but
Travers, or perhaps his man or some of the other
servants. He has good reason for keeping very quiet
now and sees absolutely nobody, not even&ndash;&ndash;not even&ndash;&ndash;not
even his grandmother, if he has one.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t he tell you whether or not he had a
grandmother, Helen?&rdquo; gasped Sadie.</p>
<p>But Helen disdained to reply, her heart suddenly
filling with rapture at the prospect of an immediate
meeting with her betrothed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>TRAVERS GLADWIN GETS A THRILL.</h3>
</div>
<p>A ring at the door bell should suggest to the ordinary
mind that some person or persons clamored for
admission, but Whitney Barnes&rsquo;s announcement
seemed to have difficulty in hammering its way into
Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s gray matter and thence downward
into the white matter of his brain cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is some one at the door for?&rdquo; he asked
vacuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see you, of course,&rdquo; snapped Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed the other with annoyance.
&ldquo;The house has been closed for ages and you are
the only one who knows I am home. Why I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Bateato skimmed in, grinning like a full moon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; his master asked, shortly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two ladies, sair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; chimed in Barnes. &ldquo;They
must have got a wireless that I was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they want?&rdquo; Gladwin addressed Bateato.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, sair,&rdquo; replied the Jap. &ldquo;They say you come
to door one minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Two ladies to see me? Are you sure?&rdquo; Travers
Gladwin was both bewildered and embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair!&rdquo; Bateato assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell them that I was here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They no ask. They say, &lsquo;Please, Mr. Gladwin
come to door!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you tell them Mr. Gladwin is not at home&ndash;&ndash;that
I&rsquo;m out, away&ndash;&ndash;in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair,&rdquo; and Bateato was about to skim out into
the hallway again when Barnes stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Bateato&ndash;&ndash;what do they look
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look nice, sair,&rdquo; and Bateato&rsquo;s moon-like grin returned
in full beam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure?&rdquo; asked Barnes, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fine,&rdquo; uttered the Jap, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young?&rdquo; inquired Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair&ndash;&ndash;much young&ndash;&ndash;come in autbile. I tell
them you no home?&rdquo; turning to Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, wait,&rdquo; responded Gladwin, his curiosity taking
fire. &ldquo;You tell them to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say you come door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; but Whitney Barnes stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better see them in here, Travers. If they really
want to see you they&rsquo;ll come in. Ask them to come in,
Bateato.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Jap was gone with the speed and noiselessness
of a mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in heaven&rsquo;s name can it be?&rdquo; whispered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Travers Gladwin as Bateato could be heard lisping in
the vestibule. Before Whitney Barnes managed to
frame a reply a swift, muffled step was audible and
Helen Burton stood framed in the narrow space between
the porti&egrave;res. Her timid cousin stopped behind
her, staring timidly over her shoulder. She was manifestly
surprised and startled as she paused and regarded
the two young men.</p>
<p>In point of startled surprise, however, Travers
Gladwin&rsquo;s emotion matched hers. He stared at her
almost rudely in his amazement and involuntarily he
turned to Whitney Barnes and said under his breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grapefruit girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes&rsquo;s lips merely framed: &ldquo;No! You
don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was going to add something more, when the
two girls came on into the room diffidently and stood
by the great carved table, close together, as if prepared
to cling to one another in case something extraordinary
happened. Travers Gladwin was the
first of the two young men to come to their rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me! Did you wish to see me?&rdquo; he said
with his best bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Helen Burton quickly, her lips trembling;
&ldquo;we want to see Mr. Gladwin, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man did not recover instantly from this
staggering jolt, and a clock somewhere in the great
hall nearby ticked a dozen strokes before he managed
to mumble:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I am&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he here?&rdquo; broke in the brown-haired beauty,
breathlessly. &ldquo;His man just asked us to come into
this room to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Mr. Gladwin did you want?&rdquo; asked that
young man incoherently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Travers Gladwin!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl
indignantly, the color mantling to her forehead. &ldquo;Is
there more than one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;that is,&rdquo; the young man turned desperately
to his friend, &ldquo;do you know Mr. Gladwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I know him?&rdquo; cried Helen Burton, and then,
with a hysterical little laugh as she turned to her
cousin, &ldquo;I should think I did know him. I know him
very, very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie Burton appeared both distressed and frightened
and slipped limply down into one of the great
chairs beside her. As Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s features
passed through a series of vacant and bewildered expressions
and as the attention of Whitney Barnes
seemed to be focussed with strange intensity upon the
prettiness of the shy and silent Sadie, anger flashed
in Helen&rsquo;s expressive eyes as she again addressed the
young man, who felt as if some mysterious force had
just robbed him of his identity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; she said, drawing herself to
the full height of her graceful figure, &ldquo;that I would
come here to see Travers Gladwin if I didn&rsquo;t know
him, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no&ndash;&ndash;of course not!&rdquo; sputtered the young
man. &ldquo;It was stupid of me to ask such a question.
Please forgive me. I&ndash;&ndash;er&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Helen turned from him as if to speak to Sadie,
who sat with erect primness suffering from what she
sensed as a strange and overpowering stroke. She
had permitted herself to look straight into the eyes
of Whitney Barnes and hold the look for a long,
palpitating second.</p>
<p>While Sadie was groping in her mind for some explanation
of the strange thrill, Whitney Barnes had
flung himself headlong into a new sensation and was
determined to make the most of it, so when Travers
Gladwin turned to him and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think Gladwin&rsquo;s gone out, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Barnes nodded and answered positively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was here only a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reply drew Helen&rsquo;s attention immediately to
Barnes and taking a step forward she said eagerly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope he&rsquo;s here. You see, it&rsquo;s awfully important&ndash;&ndash;what
I want to see him about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes nodded with extraordinary animation
and turning to Gladwin impaled that young
man with the query:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you find out if he&rsquo;s in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Gladwin had come up for air he was still
partially drowned. Turning to Helen Burton, he
forced an agreeable smile and said hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me a moment I&rsquo;ll see, but
may I give him your name?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>It was Helen&rsquo;s turn to recoil and stepping to where
Sadie had at last got upon her feet, she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell him? They both act so strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Helen, dear,&rdquo; fluttered Sadie. &ldquo;It may
be some awful trap or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this whispered conclave was going on Travers
Gladwin made a frantic signal to Whitney Barnes
behind his back and mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try and find out what it&rsquo;s all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&ndash;&ndash;leave that to me,&rdquo; said Barnes confidently.</p>
<p>Leaving her cousin&rsquo;s side, Helen again confronted
the two young men and said tremulously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not give my name. I know that sounds
odd, but for certain reasons&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, if you&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; answered
Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will just say,&rdquo; Helen ran on breathlessly,
&ldquo;that I had to come early to tell him something&ndash;&ndash;something
about to-night&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;ll understand and know
who I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly,&rdquo; said the baffled young millionaire.
&ldquo;Say that you want to see him about something
that&rsquo;s going to happen to-night&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you&rsquo;ll be so kind,&rdquo; and Helen gave the
young man a smile that furnished him the thrill he
had hunted for all over the globe, with a margin to
boot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be right back,&rdquo; he gasped, spun on his heel
and passed dizzily out into the hallway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>THRILL BEGETS THRILL.</h3>
</div>
<p>Gladwin&rsquo;s exit from the room served as a signal
for the agile-witted Barnes to strike while the iron
was hot. His friend had hardly vanished through
the porti&egrave;res when he turned to Helen with an air
of easy confidence, looking frankly into her eyes, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s singular that my friend doesn&rsquo;t know what
you referred to&ndash;&ndash;the object of your call,&rdquo; and he
nodded his head with a knowing smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, do you?&rdquo; asked Helen eagerly, coming toward
him.</p>
<p>Whitney&rsquo;s knowing smile increased in its quality
of knowingness and he spoke with an inflection that
was quite baffling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, in a confiding whisper, &ldquo;I have
an idea; but he&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;jerking his thumb over his shoulder
where Travers Gladwin was last seen departing
from view&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;is Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s most intimate
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The astonishing character of this information
served only further to confuse the beautiful Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
Burton&rsquo;s already obfuscated reasoning faculties and
hypnotize her into that receptive condition where she
was capable of believing any solemnly expressed statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; she said with a little start of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; ran on the glib Barnes, &ldquo;they are lifelong
chums&ndash;&ndash;love each other like brothers; one of
those Castor and Pollox affairs, you know&ndash;&ndash;only more
so. Never have any secrets from each other and all
that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen dropped back into her chair and her brow
wrinkled with perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s curious,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Travers
ever spoke to me about that kind of a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea was just burgeoning in her mind to ask
for the friend&rsquo;s name when Barnes hastened on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now that is singular. Are you sure that&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The sudden brisk return of Travers Gladwin saved
Barnes from an immediate excruciating tax upon his
ingenuity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; said Gladwin, going to Helen
and shaking his head regretfully, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! That&rsquo;s very provoking!&rdquo; cried Helen.
&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say he was going out, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I could have sworn he was here a few minutes
ago,&rdquo; spoke up Barnes, turning his head away
for fear his smile would suddenly get out of control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, is his man here?&rdquo; demanded the girl.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he let you in,&rdquo; blurted Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean the Japanese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the butler, perhaps,&rdquo; Gladwin corrected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helen answered mechanically.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin felt it was time for Barnes to
take a hand again, as his mental airship was bucking
badly in the invisible air currents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Gladwin&rsquo;s butler here?&rdquo; he inquired sharply,
frowning at Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Barnes promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, but he is not here,&rdquo; Gladwin communicated
to Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where is he?&rdquo; cried the exasperated Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; Gladwin asked Barnes.</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes went down for the count of one
but bobbed up serenely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he said with a nonchalant gesture.
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s giving a lecture on butling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bewildered Miss Burton did not catch the text
of this explanation. In her increasing agitation she
wrung her hands in her muff and almost sobbed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I simply must
get word to him somehow. It&rsquo;s awfully important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes saw the trembling lip and the
dampening eye and strove to avert a catastrophe that
would probably double the difficulty of probing into
the mystery. Turning to Gladwin, but half directing
his remarks to Helen, he said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been telling the ladies that you and Travers
are bosom pals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin flashed one look of amazement
and then caught on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;we are very close to each
other&ndash;&ndash;I couldn&rsquo;t begin to tell you how close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have also hinted,&rdquo; pursued Barnes, &ldquo;that
you never have any secrets from each other, and that
I felt sure that you knew all about&ndash;&ndash;all about&ndash;&ndash;a&ndash;&ndash;a
er&ndash;&ndash;to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; assented Gladwin, beginning to
warm up to his part and feel the rich thrill of the
mystery involved. &ldquo;Yes, yes&ndash;&ndash;of course&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s told
me all about to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he?&rdquo; gasped Helen, looking into the young
man&rsquo;s brown eyes for confirmation, feeling that she
liked the eyes, but uncertain that she read the confirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, everything,&rdquo; lied Gladwin, now glowing with
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>All this while the shy and silent Sadie had remained
demurely in her chair looking from one to the other
and vainly endeavoring to catch the drift of the conversation.</p>
<p>Sadie was too dainty a little soul to be possessed of
real reasoning faculties. The one thought that had
been uppermost in her mind all day was that Helen
was taking a desperate step, probably embarking
upon some terrible tragedy. She had hungered for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
an opportunity to compare notes with some sturdier
will than her own and the instant she heard Travers
Gladwin admit that he &ldquo;knew all about to-night&rdquo; she
rose from her chair and asked, breathlessly, turning
up her big, appealing eyes to Travers Gladwin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then won&rsquo;t you&ndash;&ndash;oh, please, won&rsquo;t you&ndash;&ndash;tell her
what you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something so na&iuml;ve and innocent in
Sadie&rsquo;s attitude and expression that Whitney Barnes
was charmed. It also tickled his soul to see how thoroughly
his friend was stumped. So to add to Travers&rsquo;s
confusion he chimed in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, go on and tell her what you think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not,&rdquo; said Gladwin ponderously, trying
to escape from the appealing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But really you ought to, old chap,&rdquo; reproved
Barnes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your duty to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, please do!&rdquo; implored Sadie.</p>
<p>The victim was caught three ways. Both young
ladies regarded him earnestly and with looks that
hung upon his words, while Barnes stood to one side
with a solemn long face, elbow in one hand and chin
gripped tightly in the other, manifestly for the moment
withdrawn from rescue duty. There was nothing
for the badgered young man to do but mentally roll
up his sleeves and plunge in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; with exaggerated sobriety, &ldquo;if you
must know&ndash;&ndash;I think&ndash;&ndash;that is, when I was thinking
of it&ndash;&ndash;or I mean, what I had thought of it, when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
was thinking of it&ndash;&ndash;turning it over in my mind, you
know&ndash;&ndash;why, it didn&rsquo;t seem to me&ndash;&ndash;I am afraid&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;turning
squarely on Helen&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;what I am going to say
will offend you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; cried Helen, flushing to her
tiny pink ears, &ldquo;if you are Travers&rsquo;s best friend, I
should like to know just what you think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Travers Gladwin desperately,
&ldquo;if you must know the truth, I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; breathed Sadie, overjoyed, and dropped
back in her chair.</p>
<p>But Helen Burton was far from pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like what?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;this thing to-night,&rdquo; he groped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t say that if you knew Mr. Hogg,&rdquo;
the indignant girl flung out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s a clincher&ndash;&ndash;you don&rsquo;t
know Hogg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes was up to his ears in clover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I don&rsquo;t know him?&rdquo; asked
Gladwin, a little wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how could you?&rdquo; said Helen, accusingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I know Mr. Hogg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just go out to his pen, introduce yourself
and shake his tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen failed to see the humor of this sally and
again the tears struggled for an outlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re making fun of me,&rdquo; she said, turning
away. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very unkind.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>Travers Gladwin felt a sharp pang of remorse
and hated himself for his break. In his eagerness to
repair the wound, he stepped to the young girl&rsquo;s side
and said with great seriousness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you in any way for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen looked up at him and read the soul of sincerity
and sympathy in his eyes. She was both reassured
and embarrassed by the intensity of his look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; she managed to murmur, backing away
and sitting down again.</p>
<p>The mention of Mr. Hogg had inflamed Whitney
Barnes&rsquo;s curiosity, and he desired to know more
of that unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see what Mr. Hogg has to do with
it,&rdquo; he spoke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Auntie insists upon my marrying him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen blurted this out involuntarily</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Whitney Barnes, and
Helen rewarded him with a smile of gratitude.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>HEROISM, LOVE AND SOMETHING ELSE.</h3>
</div>
<p>The embarrassment of both the girls had begun to
wear off. The two strange young men, notwithstanding
the unaccounted-for absence of the object of
Helen&rsquo;s quest, began to appear less strange. Both
possessed potent attractions and undeniable magnetism.</p>
<p>The shy and shrinking Sadie was sure she liked
that tall and slender young man with the easy drawl
and bright, humorous eyes immensely. The boldness
of his glances made her heart beat pleasantly. To
her he seemed to possess the master will and wit of
the pair, and she felt she could repose perfect confidence
in him.</p>
<p>For her part Helen was uncertain just how to sense
the situation. One side of her will urged her to leave
a message for her betrothed and hurry away. Another
strain of consciousness held her fast.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s psychic waves that had so utterly
failed in the grill room of the Ritz may or
may not have had something to do with this. He
felt inspired with a desire to prolong the interview indefinitely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
He could not recall ever having been so
attracted by the charming personality of any girl as
he was by this distressed maiden who was so eager
to see her Travers Gladwin.</p>
<p>He was flattered, even by the compliment of having
the same name as the unknown. As a further
expression of sympathy with Helen in the matter of
Mr. Hogg he said earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that your aunt insists
upon you marrying this&ndash;&ndash;hog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Helen, passionately. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s
awful, and I hate him, and I won&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I just won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re absolutely right,&rdquo; Gladwin agreed
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you do?&rdquo; cried the delighted Helen. Then,
turning triumphantly upon her cousin she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sadie&rsquo;s one idea did not include Mr. Hogg.
She considered the elopement as a separate matter
in which Mr. Hogg was in no way involved, wherefore
she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve only known Mr. Gladwin two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; retorted Helen, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve loved him for
four years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve loved Travers Gladwin four years,&rdquo; said
that young man in a voice hollow with wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only known him two weeks,&rdquo; cut in Whitney
Barnes. &ldquo;By Jove, he must be one of those retroactive
soul-mates.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loved him four years,&rdquo; said Helen stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve loved him four years in two weeks,&rdquo; said
Barnes in the tone of one trying to do a sum. &ldquo;I
give up. I can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen faced the heretic Barnes and announced impressively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since the time he so bravely risked his own
life to save that girl. It was splendid, noble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin decided it was time to call a halt
on the borrowing proclivities of the unknown double.
It was bad enough for some one to appropriate his
name, but also to take unto his bogus self the glory
of the real one&rsquo;s heroism was too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that time at Narragansett?&rdquo; he opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Four years ago when he
dashed into the roaring surf&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and fished out a cross-eyed colored lady,&rdquo;
said Gladwin hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; returned Helen with flashing eyes
and heaving bosom. &ldquo;If she had been beautiful or
some one dear to him, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been half so
noble. Oh, it was fine of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he told you about that?&rdquo; asked Gladwin,
numbed for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s much too modest. I knew
of it the day it happened, and he has been my ideal
ever since. But would you believe it, when I first
spoke to him about it he could hardly remember it.
Imagine doing such a brave thing, and then forgetting
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve forgotten lots of such things,&rdquo; said the
unrecognized hero.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s lips curled with scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the young man was stung to go on, &ldquo;and
what Travers Gladwin did wasn&rsquo;t brave at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Helen gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was so fat she couldn&rsquo;t sink,&rdquo; derided Gladwin,
&ldquo;so I swam out to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; bubbled over the young man, overjoyed at
the opportunity of discounting his own heroism, &ldquo;I
swam out to her. I told her to lie on her back and
float. Well, she did, and I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;you see, I was with him. He
pushed her to shore. Simplest thing in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen rose angrily. There was both indignation
and reproach in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shameful to try and belittle his courage, and
you say you&rsquo;re his dearest friend.&rdquo; She paused for a
moment, then went closer to the young man and said
in a different tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I understand you now&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re saying that to
try and make me change my mind. But I shan&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;not
for anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen crossed the room to her cousin and gave
Sadie the benefit of the look of defiance with which
she had confronted Travers Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, please don&rsquo;t say that, Helen,&rdquo; cried
Sadie, all a-flutter. &ldquo;I know he will agree to a postponement.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want any postponement,&rdquo; protested
Helen. &ldquo;I told you what I intended doing and I&rsquo;m
going to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, tell her again&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;d all like to hear it,&rdquo;
broke in Gladwin.</p>
<p>Helen swung around and said dramatically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry Travers Gladwin to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin reeled a little where he stood,
met and turned from the beaming stare of Whitney
Barnes. As he did so Helen came very close to him,
laid her hand on his arm and said tremulously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are his best friend. Tell me honestly, don&rsquo;t
you think I&rsquo;m right in wanting to marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a poser, but when he did summon an answer
it came right out from the heart, his eyes devouring
the beautiful girl before him as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing on earth would please me so much as to
have you marry Travers Gladwin, and I promise you
now that I am going to do everything in my power
to persuade you to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo; Helen thanked him. A moment
later she added with a perplexed smile: &ldquo;But
why did you talk about his bravery as you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the young man stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; Helen suggested brightly, &ldquo;being so
very fond of him, you hated the idea of his marrying.
Was that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that was before I saw you. I hope you
are going to like his best friend just a little.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>There was no mistaking the ardent emphasis on
the last sentence and Helen studied the young man&rsquo;s
face curiously. She turned away with a blush and
walked across the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>THE TORMENT OF OFFICER 666.</h3>
</div>
<p>Meantime Officer 666, on his aristocratic beat,
four blocks up and four blocks down the Fifth avenue
pave, was sticking to the east side of the street and
vainly trying to keep his eyes to the front.</p>
<p>It was excruciating duty, with the raven-haired Rose
wheeling her perambulator along the opposite way
and keeping, by way of feminine perversity, on a latitudinal
line with the patrolling of Michael Phelan.</p>
<p>There she was just opposite, always, never twisting
her head an inch to give him so much as a glance or
a smile. It made him wild that she should discipline
her eyes in that fashion, while his would wander
hither and yon, especially yon when Rose was in that
direction.</p>
<p>The daintiness of Rose in cap and apron with a big
white fichu at her throat, with one red cheek and the
corner of the most kissable mouth on the avenue maddeningly
visible, soon drove all memory of the Gladwin
mansion and the suspicious antics of the &ldquo;rat-faced
little heathen&rdquo; out of his mind. His one
thought was that Rose would have to cross over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
way at the fall of dusk and trundle her millionaire
infant charge home for its prophylactic pap. There
would be a bare chance for about seven or ten words
with Rose. But what was he going to say?</p>
<p>For one hundred and nine days&rsquo; running, his days
off inclusive, Michael Phelan had intercepted Rose at
that particular corner and begged her to name the
day. The best he ever got was a smile and a flash
of two laughing eyes, followed by the sally:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me $500 in the bank, Michael Phelan, and
I&rsquo;ll talk business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And why didn&rsquo;t Michael Phelan save up $500 out
of the more than $100 a month the city paid him for
his services? Rose didn&rsquo;t get a quarter of that, and
she had already saved $300, besides which she sent
a one-pound note home to Ireland every month.</p>
<p>The reason was this&ndash;&ndash;Michael Phelan turned in his
wages each month to his mother, and out of what she
allowed him to spend he couldn&rsquo;t have saved $500 in
five hundred years, at least not to his way of thinking.
The trouble was that Rose had more than an
inkling of this, and it galled her to think that her
gallant brass-buttoned cop should permit himself to
be still harnessed to his mother&rsquo;s apron strings.</p>
<p>Yes, down in the invisible depths of Rose&rsquo;s heart
she was very fond of the faithful and long-suffering
Michael, but even so she couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to
marry a milksop who was likely to make her play second
fiddle to his mother. And when Rose once made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
up her mind, she was as grimly determined as she was
pretty.</p>
<p>The sun had swung down behind the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and the trees that bordered the
Park wall had begun to trace their shadows on the
marble fronts of the mansions across the way when
Rose suddenly wheeled the gig containing Master
Croesus and walked demurely toward Officer 666.</p>
<p>Michael Phelan blushed till he could feel his back
hair singeing, but he stopped stock still and waited.
Rose gave no sign until she was within half a dozen
feet of him. Then she looked up pertly and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if it ain&rsquo;t Michael Phelan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Rose, an&rsquo; with the same question pantin&rsquo; on
his lips,&rdquo; broke out the young man, his bosom surging
and his heart rapping under his shield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that same question, Mr. Phelan?&rdquo;
asked the tantalizing Rose.</p>
<p>Officer 666 choked with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will ye name the day, d-d-d-ar&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He stopped and looked round about him fearfully,
for Sergeant McGinnis was due on his rounds and Sergeant
McGinnis, though married, had an eye like a
hawk for a pretty girl and a tongue like an adder for
a patrolman caught sparking.</p>
<p>Rose&rsquo;s eyes flashed and her lips drew taut. She
started forward, but turned her head to face Phelan
as she walked away.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an answer, Michael,&rdquo; she said in
parting, &ldquo;when ye may set up your own home for
your own&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>That was all Phelan heard and possibly all that
the young woman uttered, for just then Master Croesus
set up a bawl that was most common and vulgar
in its utter lack of restraint. There could be no more
to the interview that day with young Master Croesus
in such vociferous mood, so Officer 666 turned away
with a heaving sigh and plodded dolefully along on
his beat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>TRAVERS GLADWIN IS CONSIDERABLY JARRED.</h3>
</div>
<p>Taking time out to sense the bruised condition of
your heart isn&rsquo;t a whole lot different from taking time
out to recover from a jolt received in the prize ring.
Having released that impassioned sentence, &ldquo;I hope
you are going to like his best friend just a little!&rdquo;
young Mr. Gladwin felt a trifle groggy.</p>
<p>Until he had spoken he hadn&rsquo;t realized just how
badly his cardiac equipment was being shot to pieces
by the naked god&rsquo;s ruthless archery.</p>
<p>The fact that the case should have appeared hopeless
only fanned the flame of his ardor. He had
looked into the depths of two vividly blue eyes and
there read his destiny. So he told himself fiercely;
whereupon, in the Rooseveltian phrase, he cast his
hat into the ring.</p>
<p>He cared no more for obstacles than a runaway
horse. His very boredom of the past few years had
stored up vast reserves of energy within him, waiting
only for that psychological thrill to light the fuse.</p>
<p>As Helen Burton turned from him with the uncomfortable
feeling of one who has received a vague
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
danger signal he paused only a moment before he
again strode to her side. He was about to speak
when she took the lead from him and, looking up at
one of the masterpieces on the wall, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is his wonderful collection of paintings!
He told me all about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was what the gentlemen pugilists would call a
cross-counter impinging upon the supersensitive maxillary
muscles. It certainly jarred the owner of that
wonderful collection and caused him to turn with an
expression of astonishment to Whitney Barnes.</p>
<p>But that young man was intensely occupied in a
vain endeavor to draw more than a monosyllable from
the shrinking Sadie Burton. He missed the look and
went doggedly ahead with his own task. Helen Burton
repeated her remark that he had told her all
about his paintings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, has he?&rdquo; responded Gladwin, dully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they are worth a fortune!&rdquo; cried the girl.
&ldquo;He simply adores pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, doesn&rsquo;t he, though?&rdquo; assented the young man
in the same vacuous tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we are going to take the most valuable away
with us to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was information to jar Jove on high Olympus.
Travers Gladwin came stark awake with a new
and vital interest. There was glowing life in his
voice as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are going to take the pictures with you on
your honeymoon?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be nice?&rdquo; was the best Gladwin
could do, for he was trying to think along a dozen
different lines at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be gone for ever so long, you know,&rdquo; volunteered
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to take his collection of miniatures?&rdquo;
the young man asked in unconscious admiration
of the colossal nerve of the gentleman who had
so nonchalantly appropriated his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miniatures?&rdquo; asked Helen, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course,&rdquo; ran on Gladwin; &ldquo;and the china
and the family plate&ndash;&ndash;nearly two hundred years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t think he ever mentioned the miniatures,
or, or&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is singular,&rdquo; broke in Gladwin, striving to
conceal the sarcasm that crept into his voice. &ldquo;Strange
he overlooked the china, plate and miniatures. I don&rsquo;t
understand it, do you?&rdquo; and he turned to Barnes, who
had caught the last of the dialogue and shifted his
immediate mental interest from the shy Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I really don&rsquo;t, old man,&rdquo; said Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me show you the miniatures,&rdquo; Gladwin addressed
Helen upon a sudden inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be splendid,&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;I adore
miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are just in the next room,&rdquo; said Gladwin,
leading the way to a door to the left of the great
onyx fireplace.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>As she followed, Helen called to her cousin:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Sadie, this will be a treat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the next moment she was alone with Travers
Gladwin in the long, narrow room, two windows of
which, protected by steel lattice work on the inside,
looked out on a side street.</p>
<p>The girl did not notice that as the young man preceded
her he reached his hand under the screening
porti&egrave;re and touched a spring that noiselessly swung
open the heavy mahogany door and switched on half
a dozen clusters of lights. Neither did she notice
that Sadie had failed to follow her as her eyes fairly
popped with wonder at the treasures presented to her
gaze.</p>
<p>On one side of the room there was a long row of
tables and cabinets, and almost at every step there
was an antique chest. On the tables there were huddled
in artistic disorder scores upon scores of gold
and silver vessels and utensils of every conceivable
design and workmanship. Each cabinet contained
a collection of exquisite china or rare ceramics. On
the walls above was the most notable collection of
miniatures in America.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin waited for the young girl to have
finished her first outburst of admiration. Then he
said softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know that five generations of Gladwins
have been collecting these few trinkets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never even mentioned them!&rdquo; gasped the girl.
&ldquo;Why the paintings are nothing to these!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; chuckled Gladwin. &ldquo;It
would take a deal of this gold and silver junk to buy
a Rembrandt or a Corot. There are a couple of
Cellini medallions, though, just below that miniature
of Madame de Pompadour that a good many collectors
would sell their souls to possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he was preserving all this as a surprise
for me,&rdquo; whispered the awed Miss Burton. &ldquo;It is
just like him. I am afraid he will be awfully disappointed
now that you have shown them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or mayhap he has forgotten all about them,&rdquo;
said Gladwin, in a tone that caused his companion to
start and color with quick anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that is not true,&rdquo; she said warmly. &ldquo;You
know that Travers Gladwin is just mad about art.
How can you say such a thing, and in such a sarcastic
tone of voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the young man defended himself, inwardly
chuckling, &ldquo;you know how his memory lapsed in
regard to that heroic affair at Narragansett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen Burton turned and faced him with flashing
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was entirely different. It simply showed
that he was not a braggart; that he was different from
other men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were meant to lash and sting, but the
passion with which they were said served so to vivify
the loveliness of the young girl that Travers Gladwin
could only gaze at her in speechless admiration.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>When her glance fell before the homage of his
regard he took hold of himself and apologized on
the ground that he had been joking.</p>
<p>Then he made the rounds of the treasure room,
pointing out and giving the history of each precious
family heirloom or art object with an encyclopedic
knowledge that should have caused his companion to
wonder how he knew so much. Several times he
slipped in the pronoun I, hoping that this might have
some effect in waking Helen from the obsession that
any other than he could be the real Travers Gladwin.</p>
<p>But alas! for his subtle efforts, the hints and innuendoes
fell on deaf ears. She accepted his fund of
information as a second-hand version, exclaiming
once:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a splendid memory you have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he gave it up as a hopeless case and led the
way back into the other room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>SADIE BECOMES A CONSPIRATOR.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Be careful! Don&rsquo;t go out there!&rdquo; was the
warning that had stopped Sadie Burton in full flight
for the treasure room into which her cousin and Travers
Gladwin had vanished.</p>
<p>She was more than half way to the door in obedience
to Helen&rsquo;s command when Whitney Barnes
spoke. He was sitting on the arm of one of the great
upholstered chairs in a gracefully negligent attitude
twirling his gold key chain about his finger. He
spoke softly but with a mysterious emphasis that took
hold and held the retreating miss fast in her tracks.
She turned with a frightened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I would be all alone,&rdquo; he said solemnly.
Then as Sadie took another hurried step forward:
&ldquo;Oh, no, you wouldn&rsquo;t desert me&ndash;&ndash;you wouldn&rsquo;t be so
cruel! How would you like to have some one desert
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This mystic remark caused Sadie to turn around
and take a step toward him. She said timidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he said, getting on his feet
and going toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; objected Sadie, and began to back away.</p>
<p>The young man stopped and said in his most reassuring
tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not&ndash;&ndash;I am quite harmless, I assure you.
Now, I can see that you are in trouble&ndash;&ndash;is that not
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; Sadie admitted, delighted at this new
turn in his attitude. Her first disturbing suspicion
had been that he wanted to flirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m right,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;I would like
to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; she breathed, with increasing confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I would,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, whereat
Sadie lost all fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must hurry if we are to stop it,&rdquo; she said
in a dramatic whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it&ndash;&ndash;stop what?&rdquo; The heir of Old Grim
Barnes had launched the belief that he was about to
start something. There wasn&rsquo;t any stop in the vocabulary
of his thoughts at that minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the elopement!&rdquo; ejaculated Sadie, exploding
a little bomb that brought Whitney Barnes down
out of the clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course&ndash;&ndash;to be sure&ndash;&ndash;the elopement&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d
forgotten,&rdquo; he raced on. &ldquo;Let me look at you. No,
you must not turn away. I must look at you&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s
the only way I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>If he had to take a hand in the business of preventing
an elopement he was going to combine that business
with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure you want me to help you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so awfully much!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must look at you&ndash;&ndash;look at you very closely,&rdquo;
he said, with the utmost seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; murmured Sadie, both
pleased and frightened by his intense scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said Barnes. &ldquo;Stand very still,
with your arms at your side&ndash;&ndash;there! (my, but she&rsquo;s a
picture!) I&rsquo;ve found out the first thing&ndash;&ndash;I read it
in your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; in a stifled whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t approve of this elopement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; Sadie had yielded her eyes as if hypnotized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, I told you so!&rdquo; exulted Barnes. &ldquo;You
want to stop the elopement, but you don&rsquo;t know how
to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s perfectly true,&rdquo; confessed the spellbound
Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you how to stop it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He motioned to a chair three feet from where he
stood. The victim of this, his first excursion into the
fields of mesmerism, tripped with bird-like steps to
the chair and sat down. Barnes went easily toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
her and sat down on the arm. He was as solemn
about it as if his every move were part of a ritual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, please take off your glove&ndash;&ndash;the left one,&rdquo;
he commanded softly. Sadie obeyed mechanically.
Barnes went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before deciding upon what you should do, I&rsquo;d
like to know definitely about you&ndash;&ndash;if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to tell you?&rdquo; asked Sadie,
with a brave effort to keep her voice from running
off into little tremors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; replied the seer-faced Barnes. &ldquo;What
I want to discover you may not even know yourself.
Allow me to look at your hand, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie yielded her hand with shy reluctance, allowing
the young man to hold only the tips of her fingers.
Whitney Barnes bent his frowning eyes over the fluttering
little hand, studied the palm for a long second,
then exclaimed suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! This is extraordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie started, but her curiosity was greater than
her fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked, excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really wonderful!&rdquo; Barnes kept it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Sadie repeated, in the same little gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had taken possession of the whole hand now
and pointed with a long, ominous forefinger to the
centre of the palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which line?&rdquo; inquired Sadie, eagerly, getting her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
head very close to his as she pried into the plump,
practically lineless palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one,&rdquo; said Barnes, impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that it starts almost at your wrist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I see. Yes. What of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it runs &rsquo;way round the bump, or, that is&ndash;&ndash;the
bump of Venus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; asked Sadie innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a lot. You are very affectionate&ndash;&ndash;and extremely
shy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Sadie, amazed at the
young man&rsquo;s stupendous skill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here&rsquo;s a cunning little line,&rdquo; he pursued.
&ldquo;That shows something too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it show how to stop the elopement?&rdquo; asked
Sadie, ingenuously, but making no effort to withdraw
her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it shows that you and your friend are&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; He
paused to allow Sadie to fill the gap, and she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousins&ndash;&ndash;and we live with Auntie&ndash;&ndash;and we&rsquo;ve
been in New York a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your cousin hasn&rsquo;t known Gladwin long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only two weeks.&rdquo; Sadie was really awed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&ndash;&ndash;two weeks; and she met him at
the&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He said to himself that here was a little game that
beat any other known sport to flinders.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;At a sale of old pictures and art objects,&rdquo; said
Sadie, supremely confident that he was reading her
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sale of pictures, of course,&rdquo; Barnes led her on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was bidding on a picture and he whispered
to her that it was a copy&ndash;&ndash;a fraud, and not to
buy it. That was the way they got acquainted. But
he wouldn&rsquo;t let her tell auntie anything about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; cried Barnes. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bit of
good luck. I&rsquo;d almost overlooked that line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie was on fire with curiosity and looked eagerly
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You meet a dark man&ndash;&ndash;and he prevents the elopement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; exclaimed the delighted girl,
withdrawing her hand and jumping to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is,&rdquo; said Barnes, nodding his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; said Barnes, going very close to her.
&ldquo;Please pay attention to every word I say. <i>Do all
you can to get your cousin to change her mind; then,
if she won&rsquo;t, tell your aunt. But don&rsquo;t tell her until
the last minute, and&ndash;&ndash;but here&rsquo;s your cousin.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>HELEN LEAVES AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Helen Burton and Travers Gladwin were almost
at the door leading from the treasure room when
the young man stopped and confronted the girl, whose
eyes were still bright with the anger he had kindled
in them. He smiled rather sheepishly as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I were to tell you that I am Travers Gladwin
and that the other Travers Gladwin with whom
you think you are in love is not Travers Gladwin at
all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lip curled and she regarded him scornfully.
But she said nothing.</p>
<p>He went on into the other room, holding back the
porti&egrave;re for her to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you answer my question?&rdquo; he insisted
as she passed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is much too silly,&rdquo; she said sharply. Then in
a different tone to her cousin, who still stood by
Whitney Barnes, with her color coming and going by
turns:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sadie, why didn&rsquo;t you come with us? Travers
has the most wonderful things.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are not going to answer my question?&rdquo;
Travers Gladwin asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said it was much too silly,&rdquo; the girl returned with
increasing vehemence. Gladwin came forward and
explained to Barnes and Sadie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been asking Miss&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve been asking
how she&rsquo;d take to the idea of my being Travers Gladwin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen was now thoroughly aroused as she turned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you persist in asking such a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; he said quickly, &ldquo;whether you
were in love with the man or the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I given you the impression&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;she began,
haughtily, scarcely able to control her anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you have,&rdquo; he said warmly, and with all the
dramatic emphasis he could command. &ldquo;I am afraid
you were thinking more of that rescue at Narragansett
and your desire to be free of poor Mr. Hogg
than you were of&ndash;&ndash;of my poor friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This insult was more than she could endure. She
turned her back to address Whitney Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you be here when Travers returns?&rdquo; she
said imperiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure to see him before I leave,&rdquo; responded
the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you be kind enough to give him a
message for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had gathered up her fur piece and muff and
was moving toward the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; said Barnes, with a deferential bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much. I want you to tell him that
I cannot avoid the opera to-night&ndash;&ndash;that I have simply
got to go, but that I&rsquo;ll get away as soon as I can and
come to him directly from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; interposed Sadie in a
voice that thrilled with alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am going to do that,&rdquo; cried Helen, her face
aflame and her head held high. &ldquo;And now we must
go&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d no idea we&rsquo;d stayed so long. Good-by and
thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had taken a step toward the entrance to the
hallway when Gladwin strode forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t say good-by to me,&rdquo; he said in an
injured tone. Then with a sudden vehemence: &ldquo;But
I am glad you didn&rsquo;t, for we are going to meet
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we shall if you are here when I return,&rdquo;
she said coldly and without looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you return?&rdquo; he said, in quick surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when I come back here to-night,&rdquo; in the same
disdainful, snubbing tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to meet Travers here to-night?&rdquo; he
queried, in palpable unbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am. He wanted me to meet him at the
station, but I insisted on coming here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what time was it Travers wanted you to
meet him here? I&rsquo;d almost forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At half-past ten,&rdquo; answered Helen, taken off her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
guard and submitting unconsciously to his cross-examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, at half-past ten,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; pointedly addressing Barnes, &ldquo;must tell
him I may be late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; acquiesced Barnes, a trifle bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will be very late,&rdquo; cut in Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she caught him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean you have no idea what a mad thing you
are going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;she began icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m saying this
for your good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got to hear it,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;To leave
your aunt and run off with a man you hardly know&ndash;&ndash;why
you must be mad even to think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you speak to me in this way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If ever a young lady&rsquo;s fur was up, as the saying is,
such was the case with the enraged Helen Burton.
If her eyes had been weapons to slay, Travers Gladwin
would have been annihilated at a glance. But
he stuck doggedly to his guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody ought to speak to you,&rdquo; he ran
on. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand that this man is no good&ndash;&ndash;that
he must be a scoundrel to ask you to do such
a thing, that&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! I forbid you to say any more&ndash;&ndash;to say such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
horrible, cowardly things about him behind his back.
You, who claimed to be his dearest friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her anger was suddenly checked by a thought that
flashed in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few minutes ago you said you were glad I
was going to marry Mr. Gladwin, and that you would
do everything in your power to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I jolly well meant it,&rdquo; he acquiesced, with a
low bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You meant it! Then how could you&ndash;&ndash;oh,&rdquo; and
she started suddenly from him, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t I see it
before? <i>You&rsquo;ve been drinking.</i> Come, Sadie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes turned away with an uncontrollable snicker.
Gladwin was stunned. As he saw her leaving him
he made a last desperate effort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just a moment. Please allow me to explain.
I said I wanted you to marry Travers Gladwin, because
I am&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care why you said it,&rdquo; she flung at him,
&ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t think you know what you are saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fairly sailed through the porti&egrave;res, leaving the
young man staring after her in a state of utter mental
collapse.</p>
<p>The little cousin had listened to this impassioned
dialogue in the attitude of a frightened bird, standing
first on one foot and then on the other, struggling
with all her small nervous force to hold back the
tears. As Helen disappeared, a sob escaped her and
she ran forward. Barnes started after her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Sadie&ndash;&ndash;just one word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she wailed over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you let me call on you&ndash;&ndash;just once?&rdquo; he
pleaded, in real distress.</p>
<p>Sadie stopped, gave him one frightened glance,
smiled through her tears and burst out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she was gone and a moment later the door
slammed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>MICHAEL PHELAN TO THE RESCUE.</h3>
</div>
<p>The slamming of the front door of the Gladwin
mansion struck upon the two young men as a numbing
shock. They stood looking at each other with
eyes that saw not and with expressions of idiotic
vacancy.</p>
<p>Within the span of a brief half hour they had been
swept along on a rushing tide of emotions. They had
been thrilled and mystified, mystified and thrilled. Nor
was there any relief in the reaction. There was more
mystery and more thrill ahead that demanded immediate
action.</p>
<p>Naturally the bulk of the thrill was heaped upon
Travers Gladwin. He was not only fiercely convinced
that he had fallen desperately in love, but the unknown
beauty who had kindled this passion had revealed
that she was coming that night to his home
to meet and elope with a villain and an impostor.</p>
<p>Here was a situation to scatter the wits of a Napoleon!
It was no wonder that for a few moments
his thoughts flattened themselves against an impassable
barrier. Whitney Barnes was the first to revive
and speak.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you think of that?&rdquo; he drew out
with a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t begun to think yet,&rdquo; Gladwin managed
to stammer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no condition to think. I&rsquo;m
stunned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve travelled all over the universe in
search of a thrill, eh? Now you&rsquo;ve got one you don&rsquo;t
know what to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Gladwin was groping for a reply to this
thrust Bateato breezed in with a swift sidelong rush,
carrying a bulging portmanteau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bag all packed, sair,&rdquo; announced the little Jap,
standing at attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it back. I&rsquo;m not going now,&rdquo; said Gladwin,
gruffly. Bateato&rsquo;s entrance had nipped another idea
in the bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no go?&rdquo; said the Jap, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No go&ndash;&ndash;take back&ndash;&ndash;unpack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair; &rsquo;scuse me,&rdquo; and Bateato started off with
his usual noiseless rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Gladwin checked him. &ldquo;Wait a minute.
Don&rsquo;t unpack it. Leave it in the hall. I may
want it at a minute&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair,&rdquo; and the wondering valet steamed out
into the hallway and vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now?&rdquo; asked Barnes,
lighting a cigarette and offering one to his friend.</p>
<p>Gladwin took a turn about the room, puffing nervously
at the cigarette. Coming to a sudden stop
he faced Barnes and reeled off in a quick volley:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to marry that girl! I&rsquo;ve been all over
the world, seen all kinds of &rsquo;em, and right here in my
own house I find the one&ndash;&ndash;the only one, on the verge
of eloping with a bogus me. But I&rsquo;m going to expose
that man whoever he is&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to rescue her
from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for myself, and I&rsquo;m going to put him where
he can never annoy her any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the deuce are you going to do all this?&rdquo;
asked Barnes, planking himself down into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m going to
move the whole Western Hemisphere to do it, if
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a large contract,&rdquo; drawled Barnes. &ldquo;But
I say, Travers, if that fellow is going to steal your
pictures it sort of sizes up as a case for the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Gladwin. &ldquo;I was just thinking
of that. Where&rsquo;s that man of mine? Bateato!
Bateato!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato responded with the swift obedience of a
jinn rising from a miraculous bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair,&rdquo; and the little son of Nippon stood
stiffly at attention. &ldquo;Ladies run off in autbile,&rdquo; he volunteered
as his master hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that&ndash;&ndash;I want you to find a policeman,&rdquo;
commanded Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleesman&ndash;&ndash;where I find him?&rdquo; asked Bateato in
alarm, recalling his uncomfortable experience with
Officer 666.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Try a saloon,&rdquo; said Gladwin. &ldquo;And when you&rsquo;ve
found him, bring him here quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies steal something?&rdquo; ventured the Jap, starting
for the door. &ldquo;Autbile go fast like winds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one is going to try and steal something,&rdquo; replied
the young man. &ldquo;We must see that they don&rsquo;t.
Hurry, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair. &rsquo;Scuse me,&rdquo; and Bateato vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it,&rdquo; Barnes enthused, rubbing
his hands. &ldquo;Get a policeman in here, and when the
other Mr. Gladwin shows up nab him. Then this
marriage can&rsquo;t come off without the aid of a prison
chaplain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excitement that for an instant had transfigured
Travers Gladwin suddenly left him. A look of dismay
spread over his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, Barnes!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Because it would make a tremendous scandal.
I&rsquo;m not going to have my future wife mixed up
in any public hoorah for the newspapers. Think of
it&ndash;&ndash;her name in the papers coupled with the name of
a crook! Her picture on one side and a Rogues&rsquo; Gallery
photograph on the other. Impossible! The police
must know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you,&rdquo; said Barnes. &ldquo;What are
you going to do&ndash;&ndash;kill him and stuff him in that chest?
He probably deserves it, but it would he an awfully
unpleasant thing to have around the house.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up! Let me think,&rdquo; cut in Gladwin.</p>
<p>Then he added with swift inspiration: &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve
got it. I&rsquo;ll wait outside for her to come and warn
her of her danger. You stay in here and be on the
lookout for the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes threw up his hands and ejaculated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; He made as if to start for the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Whitney,&rdquo; cried Gladwin, &ldquo;we must see
this thing through together. You wouldn&rsquo;t want this
sweet, young, innocent girl connected with a sensational
robbery, would you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Barnes agreed soberly; &ldquo;neither would I
want any robber&rsquo;s bullets connected with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a coward!&rdquo; blurted Gladwin, hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet I am,&rdquo; acquiesced Barnes, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m alive
to tell it. Likewise I may have some marriage plans
of my own. But keep your hair on, Travers. Let us
do some real thinking, unaccustomed as we are to
it, and see if we cannot devise some safer plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What plan is there?&rdquo; groaned Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us think&ndash;&ndash;concentrate,&rdquo; suggested Barnes,
posing himself with his elbow on one hand and his
forehead supported on the fingers of the other.
Gladwin unconsciously fell into the same pose, and so
they stood, side by side, with their backs to the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought of anything?&rdquo; Barnes broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; thing,&rdquo; retorted Gladwin, peevishly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
A broken-legged minute had crawled by when Barnes
spoke again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Gladwin asked, uninspired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simplest thing in the world. Why didn&rsquo;t I think
of it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to be any good,&rdquo;
muttered Gladwin, without relinquishing his thoughtful
pose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Barnes, impressively. &ldquo;Go straight
to the aunt and tell her the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin whirled around and gripped his friend&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, you&rsquo;re right, Whitney! We can make
a lot of excuses for her, youth and innocence, and all
that. I didn&rsquo;t think you had it in you. Come on,
we&rsquo;ll go together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes&rsquo;s face fell and he stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where does she live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does she live? Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Gladwin&rsquo;s turn to throw up his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you even know her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how in blazes were you going to call on that
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By thunder! I forgot all about getting her address,&rdquo;
admitted the crestfallen Barnes.</p>
<p>Gladwin uttered a mirthless laugh and said with
sarcastic scorn:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you had a fine plan! I might have suspected
as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pile it on; pile it on,&rdquo; growled Barnes. &ldquo;I guess
the pater has me sized up about right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must do something the police will know
nothing about,&rdquo; urged Gladwin. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s concentrate
again. Maybe a real idea will break out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the two young men wrinkled their brows in
profound absorption.</p>
<p>They succeeded so well in their effort at concentration
that neither was aware of the precipitate entry of
Bateato and Michael Phelan, both of whom had
sprinted a distance of two blocks. Phelan was puffing
like a tugboat and stopped at the threshold of the
room to catch his breath. He had prepared his mind
for all manner of excitement and had burst in upon
a tomb-like silence to be greeted by two inscrutable
backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Eden Musee or a
prayer-meetin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes glanced over his shoulder and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin strove to invent an excuse for getting rid
of the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he bluffed, as if amazed at
the sudden invasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want?&rdquo; shrilled Officer 666. &ldquo;I come
to find out what <i>youse</i> want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anything,&rdquo; said the young man with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
exaggerated politeness. &ldquo;Thank you very much, but
I don&rsquo;t want anything. Good evening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening!&rdquo; echoed Barnes, with another
glance over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Michael Phelan turned purple. He hadn&rsquo;t indulged
in the most exhausting sprint in six months
to be made sport of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one of youse sent for me?&rdquo; he rasped out.</p>
<p>The two young men pointed to each other, which
only served to fan the flame of Phelan&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is one of youse Mr. Gladwin?&rdquo; he gurgled.</p>
<p>They repeated the pantomime until Gladwin
caught the fire in Phelan&rsquo;s eye and decided that it
would be better to temporize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. Gladwin,&rdquo; he bowed.</p>
<p>Phelan measured him from the ground up as he
filled his lungs for another outburst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did yez send for me?&rdquo; he demanded savagely.
&ldquo;This here little Japanaze come runnin&rsquo; wild-eyed
down me beat an&rsquo; says there&rsquo;s two women been robbin&rsquo;
the house. What&rsquo;s all this monkey business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bateato is mistaken,&rdquo; said Gladwin, forcing a
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo; cried the Jap excitedly. &ldquo;Ladies run
off quick in big autbile&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Gladwin stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell me find plece,&rdquo; persisted the Jap, who
saw the terrible wrath of Michael Phelan about to
flash upon him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Gladwin sought to shut him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say they steal&ndash;&ndash;I go saloon&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk any more! Don&rsquo;t speak again! Go
back to the hotel and wait for me. I&rsquo;ll send for you
when I want you. Stop! Not another word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato gripped his mouth with his fingers and
stumbled out of the room.</p>
<p>Avoiding the still glowering eye of Officer 666,
Travers Gladwin turned to Barnes and attempted to
say casually:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Bateato gets an idea into his head there
is no use arguing with him. There is only one thing
to do&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t let him speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man started to hum a tune and strolled
toward the heavily curtained window that looked out
on Fifth avenue.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>TRAVERS GLADWIN GOES IN SEARCH OF HIMSELF.</h3>
</div>
<p>Policeman Michael Phelan was at first undecided
whether to pursue the departing Bateato and
arrest him as a suspicious person or to remain on the
scene of mystery and get to the bottom of what was
going forward.</p>
<p>He chose the latter plan upon the inspiration that
if he arrested a millionaire he would get his name in
the paper and Rose might read of it and come to
some realization of the immensity of his official
dignity.</p>
<p>He was further urged to this course by the insolent
nonchalance of the two young men. They weren&rsquo;t
paying any more attention to him than they were to
the inanimate sticks of furniture in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what did yez send fer me fer?&rdquo; he broke
out again, hurling the words at Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you might like a drink,&rdquo; replied that
young man, turning slowly and smiling upon the enraged
bluecoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never touch it,&rdquo; shot back Phelan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s
no answer to me question.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>Gladwin stared at Phelan steadily a moment, his
smile vanishing. As he measured the officer&rsquo;s height
and build an idea came to him. His face lighted as
he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a great idea! Officer, I want you to do
me a little favor. How would you like to make five
hundred dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If he had said four hundred dollars, or even four
hundred and fifty, the effect would not have been half
so great upon Michael Phelan. The mention of an
even five hundred dollars, though, was the open
sesame to the very depths of his emotions. Five
hundred dollars represented the talisman that would
lead him safe through Purgatory into the land of
sweet enchantments. The fires of his wrath were instantly
cooled and he said feebly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are yez tryin&rsquo; to bribe me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, sergeant,&rdquo; said the young man gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no sergeant,&rdquo; Phelan retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, lieutenant,&rdquo; laughed Gladwin, his good
humor increasing as his sudden idea took shape in his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me lieutenant,&rdquo; said Phelan, with a return
of temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this way, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nix on the promotion stuff,&rdquo; shot back Phelan,
the consciousness returning that he was being kidded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m patrolman and me name is Michael Phelan, and
I&rsquo;m onto me job&ndash;&ndash;mind that!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No offense, officer,&rdquo; Gladwin hurried on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;re onto your job. No one could look at you
and doubt that&ndash;&ndash;but I&rsquo;ll give you five hundred dollars
if you&rsquo;ll lend me your uniform for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fi&ndash;&ndash;fi&ndash;&ndash;uni&ndash;&ndash;say, what kind of a game are youse
up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two big events in Phelan&rsquo;s life had blazed their
films upon his memory in a blinding flash. First there
was Rose, and then there was that nightmare of a
Coroner&rsquo;s case, when he had fled hatless and coatless
down the stairs of a reeking east side tenement, pursued
by the yells of a shrieking &ldquo;corpse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no game&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s a joke,&rdquo; replied Gladwin.</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes, who had been listening eagerly
and had sensed Gladwin&rsquo;s inspiration, chimed in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, officer; it&rsquo;s a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yez are offering me five hundred dollars for a
joke?&rdquo; said the flabbergasted Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; returned Gladwin. &ldquo;I want to take
your place; I want to become&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;stepping forward to
read the number on Phelan&rsquo;s shield&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Officer 666 for
a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan couldn&rsquo;t believe his ears. Stepping to one
side he said behind his hand to Barnes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This feller&rsquo;s off his dip. Don&rsquo;t he know that if
I lent him me uniform it&rsquo;d be me finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; spoke up Gladwin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll guarantee
to protect you. No one will ever know about it.
You&rsquo;ll never make five hundred so easy again.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;S-s-say,&rdquo; stammered Phelan, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this all
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve found out that a thief is going to break
in here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thief!&rdquo; gasped the policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just for a joke, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thief going to break in here for a joke!&rdquo; yelled
Phelan. &ldquo;Now I know you&rsquo;re batty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a regular thief,&rdquo; the young man corrected
hastily. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a friend of mine&ndash;&ndash;and I want to be
waiting in your uniform when he comes. I want to
nab him. The joke will be on him, then, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All very simple, you see,&rdquo; added Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple as&ndash;&ndash;no, I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; snarled Phelan. &ldquo;The
two of yez is bugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will see,&rdquo; went on Gladwin, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll let
me explain. In order to be a policeman I&rsquo;ve got to
have a uniform, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he has,&rdquo; urged Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yez are offering me five hundred dollars for
a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan dropped his arms limply at his side and permitted
his eyes to bulge <i>ad lib</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; cried Gladwin. &ldquo;I assure you it is
nothing serious or criminal. I just want your uniform
long enough to catch my friend and I&rsquo;ll give
you five hundred dollars for lending it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too big a risk,&rdquo; panted Phelan, producing an
elaborate bandana and mopping his brow. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>It was manifest that Officer 666 was sorely tempted.
To goad him further Travers Gladwin produced
a little roll of yellow-backed bills from his pocket.
Fluttering the bills deftly he stripped off one engraved
with an &ldquo;M&rdquo; in one corner and &ldquo;500&rdquo; in the other.
He turned it about several ways so that Phelan could
study it from all angles. Then he fluttered it before
Whitney Barnes and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Barnes, there&rsquo;s something really handsome
about these yellow-backs, isn&rsquo;t there? Notice how
that five and those two naughts are engraved? And it&rsquo;s
amazing how much a slip of paper like this will buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for Phelan. He reached for
the bill and grabbed it, stuffed it into his trousers
pocket and began unbuttoning his coat. Suddenly he
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he sputtered. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose there should be a
robbery on my beat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be fine,&rdquo; said Gladwin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a
credit to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the risk is awful,&rdquo; groaned Phelan. He
started to button up his coat again when Rose&rsquo;s taunt
came back to him. This time the tempter delivered
a vital blow and he tore off his uniform coat and
passed it to the young man. Gladwin slipped it on
over his other clothes. It fitted snugly. It just
happened that the suit he wore was dark blue and his
trousers matched accurately.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now the bonnet,&rdquo; he said, reaching for the uniform
cap and removing it from Phelan&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now officer, your sword.&rdquo; He grasped
the proffered belt and buckled it on with a flourish,
making as natty a figure of a cub policeman as one
would want to meet.</p>
<p>Phelan stood looking on dumbly, his face a study
in conflicting emotions. Barnes&rsquo;s admiration of his
friend&rsquo;s nerve was beyond power of words. When
Gladwin started for the doorway, however, he called
after him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey there, Travers, where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On duty,&rdquo; he responded cheerily. &ldquo;And by the
way, Whitney, give Mr. Phelan that tray and decanter
and see that he goes down into the kitchen and
stays there until my return. You remain on guard
up here. I&rsquo;ll look after the outside. So long, mates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; Phelan called out feebly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to know what the divvil it all means. I&rsquo;m fair hypnotized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said Gladwin, pausing and turning his
head, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;m going outside to wait for myself&ndash;&ndash;and
if I find myself, I&rsquo;ll arrest myself&ndash;&ndash;if both myself
and I have to go to jail for it. Now, do you
get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be damned if I do!&rdquo; gurgled Phelan, but
the words had scarcely passed his lips when the departmental
guise of Officer 666 vanished from sight
and the front door slammed with a bang.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>A MILLIONAIRE POLICEMAN ON PATROL.</h3>
</div>
<p>Travers Gladwin went bounding down the steps
of his own pretentious marble dwelling with an airy
buoyancy that would have caused Sergt. McGinnis to
turn mental back handsprings had he happened to
be going by on his rounds. But, fortunately, McGinnis
had passed on his inspection tour shortly before
Michael Phelan had been summoned by Bateato.
For three hours at least Officer 666 would be supreme
on his beat.</p>
<p>While the McGinnis contingency had never entered
young Gladwin&rsquo;s mind it did suddenly occur
to him as he strolled jauntily along that he had neglected
to ask Phelan to define the circumscribed limits
of his post. What if he should happen to butt into
another patrolman? Certain exposure and all his
plans would go flui! Then there was the danger of
being recognized by some of his neighbors and
friends. Ah! it came to him in a twinkling. A disguise!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll jump a taxi and
see if I can hunt up a hair store!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>The time was 7 P. M., with the inky darkness of
night blanketing the city so far as inky darkness can
blanket a metropolis.</p>
<p>The thoroughfare on which the young man stood
was a long lane of dazzle, wherefore the nocturnal
shadows offered no concealment. He cast his eyes
up and down the avenue in search of a tramp motor-hack
cruising in search of a fare. He had only a
moment or two to wait before one of the bright yellow
variety came racketing along. He stuck up his
hand and waved his baton at the driver. There was
a crunching of brakes and the taxi hove to and
warped into the curb. The chauffeur had the countenance
of a pirate, but his grin was rather reassuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, me friend,&rdquo; began the young man, in an effort
to assume Michael Phelan&rsquo;s brogue, &ldquo;do you
know the way to a hair store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; the chauffeur shot back, while his grin
went inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hair store&ndash;&ndash;I want a bit of a disguise fer my
features&ndash;&ndash;whiskers, false hair or the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did ye stop me to kid me?&rdquo; snarled the chauffeur.
&ldquo;Ye don&rsquo;t need to think &rsquo;cause you got on a bull&rsquo;s
uniform ye can hurl the harpoon into me. Or if
it&rsquo;s a drink ye&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo; reach in under the seat
an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a flask. If ye meant hair oil why didn&rsquo;t
ye say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but &rsquo;tis no drink I&rsquo;m afther,&rdquo; said the
young man. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a ride to a hair store, an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s
a tin-spot fer yer trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></div>
<p>It was the way Travers Gladwin handled the skirts
of his coat in getting at his money that convinced
the wise chauffeur that he had no real policeman to
deal with. His grin came back and looped up behind
at either ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I getcher, Steve,&rdquo; he broke out, reaching for the
bill. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s disguises ye&rsquo;re after hop inside an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
tool youse over to Mme. Flynn&rsquo;s on Avenue A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To demonstrate to his uniformed fare that speed
laws in the greater city of New York fail to impose
any manner of hamper upon the charioteering of the
motor-driven hack, the chauffeur of this canary-colored
taxi scampered across town at a forty-mile-an-hour
clip, during which Patrolman Gladwin failed
to familiarize himself with the quality of the cab&rsquo;s
cushions. But it was not a long ride and there was
some breath left in him when the cab came to a crashing
stop.</p>
<p>The young man was on the point of opening the
door when a voice stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kape inside, ye boob, an&rsquo; pull the blinds down.
There&rsquo;s coppers on every corner. Now, what is it ye
want in the way o&rsquo; whiskers or hair? Ye can slip
me the change through the crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the prevailin&rsquo; style?&rdquo; asked Gladwin, with
a laugh. &ldquo;Are they wearin&rsquo; brown beards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not,&rdquo; mumbled the chauffeur. &ldquo;I guess
a wee bit mustache an&rsquo; a black wig will do ye, an&rsquo; if
ye want I&rsquo;ll get ye a pair of furry eyebrows.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; cried the young man, poking a $20 bill out
through the crack in the door, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;
The door slammed and a great stillness clapped down,
broken only by the running of the taximeter, which
seemed to be equipped with a motor of its own.</p>
<p>The millionaire cop sat back luxuriously and inhaled
a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gad!&rdquo; he exclaimed to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really beginning
to live. Nothing but thrills for four hours
and more and larger ones coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently the chauffeur returned, opened the door
a few inches and shoved in a small package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll have to paste &rsquo;em on in the dark,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Or ye can light a match. Ye&rsquo;ll find a wee mirror
in the bundle. Now where&rsquo;ll I drive yez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to me fixed post,&rdquo; said Gladwin, &ldquo;only take
it easy while I put me face on straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye don&rsquo;t git it on straighter nor your brogue,&rdquo;
chuckled the chauffeur, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll not decave a blind man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another instant the return journey was under
way at reduced speed.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin first tried on the wig. It was
three sizes too large and he had to discard it.
Next he had some trouble in deciding which was the
mustache and which the eyebrows. He had burned
his fingers pretty badly before he made the selection
and likewise he had singed one of the eyebrows.</p>
<p>But he managed to plaster them all on before the
cab stopped and after one glance in the little mirror
he was confident the disguise would answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></div>
<p>When he stepped out of the taxi, at almost the
very spot where he had boarded it, he felt that a
big weight had been lifted from his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like me?&rdquo; he asked the chauffeur,
gayly. &ldquo;Is it an improvement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say yis nor no to that,&rdquo; said the chauffeur,
&ldquo;but &rsquo;tiz a disguise, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what ye were
wantin&rsquo;. Thim eyebrows is grand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; laughed Officer 666, &ldquo;an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s a wan
hundred dollar bill which asks ye to forget me uniform,
me number an&rsquo; me face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tiz done,&rdquo; agreed the chauffeur, tucking away
the bill, &ldquo;on&rsquo;y take a tip from a wise gink an&rsquo; keep
deep in the shadders. An&rsquo; whin ye pinch your frind
don&rsquo;t let him holler too loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yellow taxi was gone with a rush, leaving
Gladwin to wonder at the amazingly shrewd guess
of its pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I pinch me frind,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
just what I said to Phelan. Why&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He was gazing after the taxicab when from the
opposite direction there suddenly rolled into view
a vast touring car with a familiar figure at the wheel,
and alongside the familiar figure a very pretty girl.</p>
<p>The car was barely rolling along, while its two
occupants were talking earnestly, their heads as close
together as was possible under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Parkinson, as I&rsquo;m alive!&rdquo; uttered Travers
Gladwin. &ldquo;Me old college chum, and as per
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
usual&ndash;&ndash;making love. Yis, me grinning chauffeur
frind, here&rsquo;s where we make a pinch an&rsquo; test Mme.
Flynn&rsquo;s eyebrows. Officer, do your duty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out he stepped into the roadway and raised his
nightstick.</p>
<p>The big car came to a sudden stop and the two
occupants stared angrily at the cause of the interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrest yez in the name o&rsquo; the law,&rdquo; cried
Patrolman Gladwin, scowling so fiercely that one
of the eyebrows was in danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; snorted the young aristocrat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re me pris&rsquo;ner,&rdquo; said Gladwin, easily. &ldquo;I
arrest ye fer breaking the speed laws&ndash;&ndash;racin&rsquo; on
the aven-oo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an outrage!&rdquo; cried the pretty passenger. &ldquo;We
were scarcely crawling, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be joking, officer,&rdquo; said Johnny Parkinson,
not very belligerently, for he had a bad
record for speeding and wasn&rsquo;t sure that some earlier
offense was not involved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not jokin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Gladwin, walking to the
door of the tonneau and opening it, &ldquo;and ye&rsquo;ll
oblige me by drivin&rsquo; to the police station.&rdquo; He got
in and lolled back cozily in the cushions.</p>
<p>Johnny Parkinson let in the clutch and rolled northward.
This was the strangest &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; of his experience
and he didn&rsquo;t know just what to make of
it. After he had gone a few blocks he turned on
his captor-passenger and said:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Which station shall I drive to?&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m sure there
must be some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake,&rdquo; responded Gladwin, fairly
screaming with joy inside at the bewildered and
frightened look of his friend. &ldquo;As for police stations,
take your pick. I ain&rsquo;t particular. Drive round the
block a couple o&rsquo; times an&rsquo; make up your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny Parkinson turned the first corner and then
turned again into Madison avenue. Gladwin could
hear the couple on the front seat whispering excitedly,
the girl almost in hysterics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve simply got to do something, Johnny,&rdquo; she
was saying. &ldquo;You know if we get our names in the
paper father will be furious. Remember what he
said about the last time you were arrested for speeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Running along Madison avenue, Johnny Parkinson
slowed down, turned again to the uniform in the back
seat and said tremulously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we compromise this, Officer? I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on the aven-oo, Mr. Parkinson. You&rsquo;ve got
too bad a record. But if ye&rsquo;ll run the machine over
into Central Park where there ain&rsquo;t so many sergeants
roamin&rsquo; round we might effict a sittlemint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile of great gladness illuminated the features
of Johnny Parkinson. He let in the clutch with a bang
and it was only a matter of seconds before the
ninety horsepower car glided in through the Seventy-second
street entrance to Central Park and swung into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
the dark reaches of the East Drive. Slowing down
again the young man at the wheel turned and said
anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The smallest I&rsquo;ve got is a century and I really
need some of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s aisy,&rdquo; rejoined Gladwin. &ldquo;Sure&rsquo;n I change
hundred dollar bills ivry day. Slip me the paper
an&rsquo; here&rsquo;s a fifty, which is lettin&rsquo; ye off aisy, seein&rsquo;
ye&rsquo;re an ould offinder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The transfer of bills was made swiftly, whereupon
Gladwin commanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now run me back to me peg post an&rsquo; drop me
off, on&rsquo;y take it slow an&rsquo; gradual or I might have to
pinch yez again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Gladwin heard the young girl
say passionately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Johnny, how could you give him the money?
He&rsquo;s no better than a thief. I hope you&rsquo;ve taken his
number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good, dearest,&rdquo; said Johnny,
sadly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in together and I&rsquo;d only get
the worst of it. But did you notice, Phyllis, that
he looks a lot like Travers Gladwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; retorted the girl. &ldquo;Travers Gladwin
is good looking, and this man&rsquo;s nothing but an
Irish monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was about to speak again when she was
sure she heard muffled laughter behind her. Then
the car sped on into the avenue and just missed colliding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
with a Fifth avenue motor &rsquo;bus. Officer 666
was put down a block from his own home and resumed
the patrolling of the immediate precincts of
the Gladwin mansion. His only parting salute from
Johnny Parkinson&rsquo;s car was a flashing glance of
contempt from the girl, whose identity he strove in
vain to place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>OLD GRIM BARNES GETS A THRILL.</h3>
</div>
<p>The precipitate departure of Travers Gladwin left
Whitney Barnes and the shirt-sleeved Michael Phelan
staring blankly at each other. The unfrocked policeman
was anything but an imposing figure and the
contortions of distress in his rubicund countenance
were grotesque enough to kindle the sense of humor
in a far less volatile mind than that of Whitney
Barnes. His smile came to the surface and spread
out in full blossom. But it failed to find reflection in
the features of Mrs. Phelan&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the divvil are ye grinnin&rsquo; at?&rdquo; snarled Phelan.
&ldquo;Ye wouldn&rsquo;t see no fun in it if it mint your
job an&rsquo; your pension an&rsquo; your silf-respect. Now, what
is it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you have me, officer,&rdquo; responded the young
man, lightly. &ldquo;The riddle is dark on all four sides.
You and I are in the same boat&ndash;&ndash;guardians of the
castle against the mysterious foe. While you guard
the moat from the kitchen I will operate the portcullis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk sinse, will yez?&rdquo; hissed Phelan. &ldquo;What
in blazes has moats an&rsquo; portcollars to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Only in a way of speaking,&rdquo; laughed Barnes.
&ldquo;But calm yourself, Mr. Phelan, my friend is both
wise and discreet. He will do no dishonor to your
cloth, and together we will see that you suffer no
material damage in this life. I am unable to explain
further without uttering more confusion, so kindly
take yonder tray down into the kitchen. That little
door on the extreme right I believe opens the way
to the lower regions. I am sure Bateato left the
lights on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the blessed saints presairve ye if it&rsquo;s a
trap ye&rsquo;re riggin&rsquo; fer Michael Phelan,&rdquo; breathed that
gentleman, shaking his head dubiously. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not a
step I&rsquo;ll go down into that kitchen till yez lead me
the way, and if there&rsquo;s any more ravin&rsquo; maniacs down
in them quarters I warn ye it&rsquo;s shootin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be after
doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Phelan patted the bulge in his hip pocket
as he swung around.</p>
<p>Barnes led the way through the long, narrow corridor
to the rear of the house, while Phelan followed,
muttering and grumbling every inch of the
way. There was no further conversation between
them while they investigated the elaborate quarters
below stairs, and at last Phelan ceased his mutterings
and accepted from Barnes an armful of cook
books with which to regale himself until he was summoned
to resume his uniform.</p>
<p>Returning to the big silent rooms above, Whitney
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Barnes was utterly at a loss how to occupy himself.
The thundering stillness got on his nerves and he
found himself thinking of a dozen different things
at once. But as idea pursued idea the image of the
shy and winsome Sadie persisted in intervening.</p>
<p>So he dropped Travers Gladwin, or rather the
two Travers Gladwins, Helen, Phelan and all the
others from his mind and gave himself up to the
beatific contemplation of the picture that was most
soothing to his spirits.</p>
<p>For a while he lolled back in one of the great chairs,
shut his eyes and revolved pleasant visions. Suddenly
he thought of his father and sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I&rsquo;ll break the news to the pater,&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a telephone somewhere in this house,
and I&rsquo;ll call him up at his club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fairly danced out into the hallway, switching
on lights wherever he could find a button to press.
Presently he located the phone in a secluded alcove
and slumped down on a divan with the instrument in
his lap.</p>
<p>As a matter of fixed routine, it happened that
this particular hour found Joshua Barnes, mustard
magnate, settled down to his cigar and coffee,
in which he found immense comfort after a
hearty meal. To be disturbed at this most luxurious
moment of the day was, to a man of his temperament,
about as pleasant a sensation as being
stung by a rattlesnake.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>He sent the club attendant back to the phone
with a savage growl and the message to his son to
call him up in an hour or to come to the club in person.
The attendant crept back with the report that
Barnes junior insisted that there could be no delay&ndash;&ndash;that
he had a vastly important matter to report on.</p>
<p>Old Grim Barnes flung down his cigar, gulped
his coffee till he choked and stamped off to the telephone
booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he bellowed.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;That you, pater&ndash;&ndash;sorry to disturb you, but&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Of course it&rsquo;s important and no damn nonsense
about it, I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;No, I haven&rsquo;t been arrested and am not in a
police station.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Then what the devil&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;No devil, nothing of the sort. On the contrary,
quite the opposite! I&rsquo;ve called you up to report
progress&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;You know better than that, dad. I&rsquo;ve only had
two drinks.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d better take four more and sober up? Now,
Father Barnes, will you oblige me by cooling off
for an instant? You recall that this afternoon you
gave me a year within which to find a wife. Well,
I&rsquo;ve found one already.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Now you know I&rsquo;m intoxicated? Was my voice
ever soberer&ndash;&ndash;now listen.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;You won&rsquo;t listen? But you must. This is all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
up to you. You commanded. I obeyed. Say, dad,
she&rsquo;s an angel. I&rsquo;m madly in love with her.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Who is she? Well, er, I really don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;that
is, her first name is Sadie. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Sadie what? Sadie Omaha&ndash;&ndash;I mean she lives in
Omaha.</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;What is her last name and who are her people?
To tell you the truth I haven&rsquo;t found that out
yet. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m an ass?&ndash;&ndash;a blankety, blank ass? Just wait
till you see her! I met her up at Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s,
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ndash;&ndash;Travers is in Egypt! No, yes, of course he is,
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The final outburst of paternal expletive fairly
hurled Whitney Barnes from the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, by thunder! He&rsquo;s rung off in a rage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the ungrateful parent for you!&rdquo; he muttered
as he made his way back to Gladwin&rsquo;s drawing
room. &ldquo;Here I&rsquo;ve gone and broken my neck to
fall in love for him and that&rsquo;s all the thanks I get
for it. Well, I&rsquo;ll marry her in spite of him, if he
doesn&rsquo;t leave me a dollar. I could starve in a garret
with her, and if I got too dreadfully hungry I could
eat her. Hi, ho! but, say, Mr. Whitney Barnes, you
had better switch off some of these lights. This house
isn&rsquo;t supposed to be occupied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left just one heavily shaded bronze lamp abeam.
Then he carefully drew all the curtains across the windows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
and tiptoed about the room with the air of a
sinister conspirator. He stopped in front of the great,
mysterious-looking chest to one side of the entrance
to the hallway, lifted the heavy lid and looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where we will put our dead,&rdquo; he said, with
a lugubrious grin, let down the lid softly and crossed
abruptly to the roomiest and coziest chair beside the
curtained window. After another sweeping glance
about the room he stretched his arms and yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon I better sleep off that jag the pater
presented me over the wire,&rdquo; he chuckled, and down
he slid into the soft upholstery, raising his long legs
upon another chair and sighing with deep contentment.
His eyes roved about the room for a moment,
when he smiled suddenly and quoted:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>Why, let the stricken deer go weep;<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>The hart ungalled play,<br />
For some must watch, while some must sleep:<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>So runs the world away.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>And upon the suggestion of the immortal bard he
chose the sleeper&rsquo;s end of it and passed away.</p>

<h3>AUNTIE TAKES THE TRAIL.</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Mix a tablespoonful of corn starch with a quarter
of a cupful of water. Stir this into a cupful of boiling
water, and boil for two minutes; then add the
juice and rind of a lemon and a cupful of sugar, and
cook three minutes longer. Beat an egg very light,
and pour the boiling mixture over it. Return to the
fire and cook a minute longer, stirring all the while&ndash;&ndash;a
most tasty lemon sauce&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo; &rsquo;ell wit&rsquo; these limon sauces!&rdquo; exploded Michael
Phelan, hurling the book across the room and
bounding from his chair. &ldquo;Sure &rsquo;n I&rsquo;ll niver be able
to look a limon in the face agin. Limon, limon, limon&ndash;&ndash;these
blame books are filled wit&rsquo; &rsquo;em. &rsquo;Tis a limon
I am mesilf an&rsquo; all fer a limon colored bill. But I&rsquo;ll
not stand it a minute longer, shut down into this
tomb wit&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but mice fer comp&rsquo;ny. Wurra!
Wurra! Rose O&rsquo;Neil, but your blue eyes an&rsquo; your
black hair an&rsquo; your divilish smiles have spelled me
finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan wrung his hands and took a turn around
the room. Now and again he stopped and shook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
his fist at the ceiling, and at last, beside himself, he
made a rush for the door that led to the stairway.
Opening a crack, he listened. Nothing but heavy
silence beat down on him from above and he shivered.
He looked back into the kitchen and his eye
fell on the pile of cookbooks. With a muttered oath
he flung himself through the doorway and crept
upstairs.</p>
<p>He had to feel his way through the narrow slit
of a corridor above, and it was with an immense
sigh of relief that he opened the door and stepped
into the great drawing room he had left. In the dim
light of the one glowing lamp he made out Whitney
Barnes deep in the embrace of a great chair and
sonorously asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way he&rsquo;s kapin&rsquo; watch!&rdquo; hissed
Phelan through his teeth, as he fairly pounced across
the room. First he seized the young man&rsquo;s feet and
threw them from their resting place to the floor,
exclaiming as he did so:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you&ndash;&ndash;wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; mumbled the young man in his sleep,
&ldquo;I could abide with you always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yez be afther dearin&rsquo; me,&rdquo; snarled Phelan.
&ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes opened his eyes and asked thickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wassa masser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are yez doin&rsquo; there?&rdquo; cried Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I doing here,&rdquo; rejoined Barnes, now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
wide-awake and getting on his feet. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m keeping
watch at the window&ndash;&ndash;on guard as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On guard, is it?&rdquo; snorted Phelan. &ldquo;On guard an&rsquo;
snorin&rsquo; like a bazoo. &rsquo;Tis a fine night watchman ye&rsquo;d
make. But, say, hain&rsquo;t ye seen nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; Mr. Gladwin
since?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I told you, Officer,&rdquo; returned Barnes severely,
&ldquo;that I would let you know just as soon as he returned.
I have been keeping guard here, and no one
could enter the house without my knowing it. You
will kindly return to the kitchen and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you got no word from him?&rdquo; asked Phelan,
in manifest distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my! oh, my!&rdquo; complained Phelan bitterly.
&ldquo;Sure this is the worst muddle I ever got mesilf into!
The sergeant will find him in that uniform, sure.
It&rsquo;ll cost me me job, that&rsquo;s what it will! How late is
it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes consulted his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes past ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howly Moses! If I ever get out of this scrape
I pity the mon that offers me money fer the lind o&rsquo;
me uniform agin. I&rsquo;ll grab him by the&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>A sharp ring at the doorbell cut him short and
wrote another chapter of tragedy in his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! there&rsquo;s some one at the door,&rdquo; spoke up
Barnes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go and see who it is, Officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; gurgled Phelan. &ldquo;Me! an&rsquo; walk into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
arms o&rsquo; Sergeant McGinnis. Let &rsquo;em stay out, whoever
it is, or yez go yersilf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Barnes, &ldquo;and in case it should be
your friend McGinnis you better go and hide in the
kitchen, like a brave officer. I&rsquo;ll let you know when
it&rsquo;s time to come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan did not budge as Barnes left the room, but
stood muttering to himself: &ldquo;How the divvil did I
iver let mesilf in fer this thing&ndash;&ndash;I dunno! That&rsquo;s
what love does to yez&ndash;&ndash;a plague on all women!
If&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen, Helen, where are you?&rdquo; cried a shrill feminine
voice that seemed to clutch the very heart of
Michael Phelan with a grip of ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howly murther! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he breathed,
backing away from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Murder! Police!&rdquo; was borne in on him
in even more agonized tones, and before he could
move another step Mrs. Elvira Burton burst into the
room&ndash;&ndash;flushed and wild-eyed&ndash;&ndash;in the throes of one
of her famous fits of hysterics.</p>
<p>Phelan took a backward leap as she came toward
him, and she yelled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! stop! Where&rsquo;s my niece?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his eyes almost out on his cheeks Phelan managed
to articulate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t deny it!&rdquo; Mrs.
Burton shrilled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what yez&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about,&rdquo; protested
Phelan, backing toward the doorway that led to the
kitchen.</p>
<p>The hysterical woman stopped, struggling for
breath. When she could speak again she said fiercely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Phelan began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me who you are or I&rsquo;ll have you arrested&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll
call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for the love of hiven, don&rsquo;t call the police!&rdquo;
begged Phelan, still backing toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me what you are doing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer no questions,&rdquo; cried Phelan. With a
desperate backward leap he gained the narrow doorway
behind and vanished. He pulled the door shut
and clung to the knob, hearing the muffled demand
hurled at him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Come back here! Helen! Helen! I
want my niece! Oh, Helen, come to auntie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Barnes and the other pretty ward of the distraught
Mrs. Burton entered the room. The young
man had stopped Sadie in the hallway to ask a few
questions and endeavored to soothe the frightened
girl. He had taken possession of her hand again and
still held it as he led her to the door of the drawing
room.</p>
<p>They did not attempt to enter until after the precipitate
disappearance of Michael Phelan. As Mrs.
Burton stood looking helplessly at the closed door,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
her ample bosom heaving and her breath coming in
short hysterical gasps, Barnes was whispering to
Sadie:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss Sadie, I can&rsquo;t tell you how overjoyed I
am at seeing you again. And so that&rsquo;s your auntie&ndash;&ndash;fancy
that chap refusing to meet her! Why&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>That was as far as he got. Auntie suddenly wheeled
round and caught sight of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Gladwin!&rdquo; she screamed and made a rush
for him.</p>
<p>With all his characteristic aplomb and insouciance
Whitney Barnes was unable to face such a rush with
any degree of calmness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! a mistake!&rdquo; he retorted and sought to
sidestep.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton was too quick for him and seized his
arm in an iron grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Helen? What have you done with
her?&rdquo; she demanded in the same wild tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I-I-I d-d-don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; stammered Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have hidden her somewhere and you must
give her up,&rdquo; stormed the woman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a scoundrel&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re
a kidnapper&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re a wretch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flung Barnes from her with all her strength and
he slammed against the wall. She was about to
charge upon him again when Sadie rushed between
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, auntie,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;This is not Mr. Gladwin.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; chimed in Barnes, trying to
shake himself together again. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t Mr. Gladwin
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who are you?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s some one else,&rdquo; Sadie assured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you bet I am,&rdquo; continued Barnes, striving his
best to appear his usual jaunty self. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m some one
else entirely different&ndash;&ndash;I-I&rsquo;m not Gladwin in the
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; shot out Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on guard&ndash;&ndash;keeping
watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it! I knew it!&rdquo; and the shrill voice rose
to a plangent pitch again. &ldquo;You have hidden her
away. Helen! Helen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, now&ndash;&ndash;my dear lady,&rdquo; broke in Barnes,
soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not your dear lady,&rdquo; she flashed on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear auntie&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s hysteria was
becoming contagious&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he
added hastily, &ldquo;your niece, Miss Helen, is not here.
I&rsquo;ve been watching for hours, and she&rsquo;s not here&ndash;&ndash;no
one is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shirt-sleeved man is here&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;re
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, auntie, he&rsquo;s a friend of Mr. Gladwin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; interposed
Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha! I knew it!&rdquo; screamed Mrs. Burton.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the plot.&rdquo; And again she plunged for him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
crying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re his friend&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;re helping him to
steal my niece. But you shan&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll prevent it&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll
search the house. Come, Sadie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes dodged skilfully and permitted Mrs. Burton
to pass out into the hallway. Sadie was about to
follow when the young man stopped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must go with auntie,&rdquo; Sadie objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind auntie now. I want to tell you about
your cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know where she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what can you tell me about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything! Sit down, please. Remember you
asked me to help you and I promised to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton had managed to switch on the lights
in the big reception room back of the hallway and
was searching behind curtains, under books, behind
pictures and in innumerable other places, after the
manner of hysterical women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I would help you, you know,&rdquo; ran on
Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Sadie looked up into his eyes confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why I promised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Why did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes bent down toward her and said with all the
ardor he could command:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Because from the moment I saw you I became
your slave. When I saw how distressed you were
about your cousin this evening my heart went out
to you&ndash;&ndash;the instant you left I decided to act and I&rsquo;ve
been acting ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how kind&ndash;&ndash;what have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, watched. You don&rsquo;t understand that, but it&rsquo;s
a very serious matter. If you only knew how serious
this whole thing is you&rsquo;d realize how I am trying
to help you, and the risk I am taking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how noble of you! How brave you are!&rdquo;
and if Mrs. Burton had waited another moment before
returning to the room she would have had another
case for hysterics on her hands entirely separate
and independent of Helen&rsquo;s elopement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find her&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s in the
house,&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>Barnes regarded her dumbly for a moment and
then said slowly and ponderously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lady, I assure you that she is not in
the house. If you&rsquo;ll only listen a moment&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t listen,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton snapped him up.</p>
<p>Sadie jumped to her feet and rallied to Barnes&rsquo;s
defense:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, auntie, this gentleman has been doing everything
he can to help us&ndash;&ndash;everything. He&rsquo;s been
watching.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Watching? Watching what?&rdquo; demanded auntie,
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it! What? What haven&rsquo;t I been
watching&ndash;&ndash;for hours?&rdquo; cried Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what have you been watching for?&rdquo; Mrs.
Burton shrilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For hours&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean for yours&ndash;&ndash;and Miss Sadie&rsquo;s sake, and
now if you&rsquo;ll wait here and watch with me&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I see it all,&rdquo; stormed Mrs. Burton, shaking
her hand at Barnes wrathfully. &ldquo;You want to
keep us here. Helen and that scoundrel have gone
and you want to prevent our following them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, auntie, he&rsquo;s trying to help us,&rdquo; sobbed Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying to you, child,&rdquo; said Mrs. Burton,
shooting vindictive glances at Barnes. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
know he&rsquo;s a friend of that wretch Gladwin? But
they can&rsquo;t hoodwink me. I know what to do now!
Helen is not of age&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll swear out a warrant&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll
have him arrested for abduction, a State prison offense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; implored Barnes, in real alarm,
&ldquo;you must not do that. That will make the whole
thing public, and that is just what Gladwin is trying
to avoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose I know that,&rdquo; sneered Mrs.
Burton. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably a bigamist. He may have
a dozen wives living&ndash;&ndash;the beast!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But won&rsquo;t you understand,&rdquo; insisted Barnes.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to save her, privately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton regarded him as if she had suddenly
realized he was a raving maniac. And by way of
justifying her inspiration he stumbled on blindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;you see, it&rsquo;s this way. Gladwin
and I only found it out this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;quite by accident.
And we decided to save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough&ndash;&ndash;stop!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Burton.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking all this nonsense to detain us. But I
won&rsquo;t stay a minute longer. Come, Sadie, we will
go to the police station. I&rsquo;ll never rest until I have
that monster in jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with another dagger glance at Barnes she
swept her niece and herself out of the room and out
of the house to the waiting automobile.</p>
<p>Barnes gripped his forehead in both hands to
steady his reeling brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just like a woman,&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;After explaining explicitly she&rsquo;s going to have him
arrested. But, by Jove! I must find Travers and
warn him that the police are on his track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing his hat and stick he rushed out into the
night, just in time to see Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;or rather
Jabez Hogg&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;big car glide away from the curb
and shoot down the avenue like a vast projectile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>PHELAN MEETS HIS UNIFORM AGAIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>About the time the Gladwin mansion was ringing
with the shrill staccato outbursts of Mrs. Elvira
Burton, the owner of that luxurious dwelling was
leaning against the Central Park wall a few blocks
away engaged in earnest conversation with a small
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to be in bed,&rdquo; the young man was
saying, severely, looking down at the lad and noting
how thinly he was clad and yet how little he appeared
to suffer from the sting of the chill night air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bed nuttin&rsquo;,&rdquo; responded the boy, curtly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
lookin&rsquo; fer me dog. Did yez seen him go by&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s
a t&rsquo;oroughbred an&rsquo; lost one ear battlin&rsquo; with a
bull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re her brother, then,&rdquo; laughed Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s brudder?&rdquo; asked the boy, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Gladwin, &ldquo;or I should say the
brother of Miss May Henny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hully gee!&rdquo; ejaculated the boy. &ldquo;Did dat kid
skin out too after me an&rsquo; the old man tellin&rsquo; her to
stay in bed an&rsquo; shut up her bellerin?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gladwin, &ldquo;and the young lady, with
my aid, found the valuable animal you are searching
for&ndash;&ndash;a black dog with a white spot over the right eye
and no tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hully gee!&rdquo; cried the boy, ecstatically. &ldquo;She
found him, eh? Well, who&rsquo;d a-t&rsquo;ought it, an&rsquo; me
lookin&rsquo; fer him tree hours. Where did she find him,
officer? His name&rsquo;s Mike&ndash;&ndash;named after me old
man&rsquo;s boss what bites nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found him in the park in company with a
disreputable friend,&rdquo; said Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A yaller mut?&rdquo; asked the boy, with a contemptuous
emphasis on the <i>mut</i>. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s the janitor&rsquo;s dog
an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s nottin&rsquo; but a tramp. I wisht he&rsquo;d fall in de
river an&rsquo; get et by a catfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wish him all that hard luck,&rdquo; laughed
Gladwin, &ldquo;for he had a large bone he was sharing
with Mike. I was watching them over the park wall
when May came along. I sent them all, and the
bone, home in a taxicab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a which?&rdquo; ejaculated the boy, while his eyes
popped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a taxi,&rdquo; said Gladwin, lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, say,&rdquo; and the little chap&rsquo;s jaw fell, &ldquo;now I
know you&rsquo;re kiddin&rsquo;. Where&rsquo;d May git the price of
a taxi, an&rsquo;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I arranged all that,&rdquo; the uniformed mystery
explained reassuringly, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;d like I&rsquo;ll
call one for you. You look pretty tired. I guess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
you&rsquo;ve walked a good many miles on the trail of
Mike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youngster tried to speak, but could not. The
very thought of a ride in a taxicab froze his brain.
Gladwin took him by the hand and led him to the
curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, would you prefer a yellow or a red one?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s all kinds going by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaller,&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;I likes them best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had only a moment to wait, when one of
the mystic yellow hue cruised round a corner and
came toward them. Gladwin hailed it and the chauffeur
stopped with a wondering look at the pair.</p>
<p>Gladwin had a bill ready in his hand and passed it
up to the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this boy over to No. 287 East Eightieth
street,&rdquo; commanded Gladwin, &ldquo;and whatever you&rsquo;ve
got left out of the tenspot above what the meter
registers, split the change with the boy. And as
for you son, patting the urchin on the head, you keep
your eye peeled on the meter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! Will I?&rdquo; responded the boy, and as Gladwin
opened the door he hopped in and took up a
perch where he could best observe the fascinating
operations of the register.</p>
<p>The chauffeur, a bullet-headed, cross-eyed individual,
squinted at the bill half a dozen times before
he stowed it away in his pocket and set the meter.
Then he made a swift, fierce scrutiny of Travers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
Gladwin&rsquo;s face, shook his head, swallowed a mouthful
of oaths, threw in the clutch and spurted diagonally
for the cross street.</p>
<p>As he vanished, the uniformed similitude of Officer
666 consulted his watch, made out that it was
almost 10.30 and strode rapidly in the direction of
his home. He wore a smile that was fairly refulgent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have missed this night patrol for a
hundred thousand,&rdquo; he said inwardly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and they say
that the life of a patrolman is a monotonous
drudgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arriving at the stoop of his home he reconnoitered
the avenue in both directions and then looked up at
the black windows of the house. A sudden lull had
come upon the neighborhood and there seemed not
a soul stirring. He sped lightly up the stoop and let
himself in. He was surprised to find the lights burning
brilliantly in the drawing-room and no sign of
Barnes. The heavy curtains, he saw, were carefully
arranged to prevent the merest ray of light from
showing outside. He took the further precaution,
however, of turning off all but the single globe in one
lamp.</p>
<p>He speculated on the disappearance of Barnes until
he heard a stealthy step approaching through the
corridor that led to the kitchen. Without noise he
glided to the window and concealed himself behind
the curtains.</p>
<p>He had scarcely hidden himself when the hinged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
panel that answered for a door opened slowly and
the countenance of Michael Phelan protruded itself
into the room. The Phelan shoulders and embonpoint,
still in negligee, followed. Taking a cautious
step forward he uttered behind his hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pst! Pst! Hey, youse there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer, and Phelan worked his
head round like a wary weazel, muttering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that woman, I wonder? She must
have took that Slim Jim away with her. Musha!
Musha! If they should call the police. Bad cess
to that feller an&rsquo; his five hundred dollar bill. Murther!
Murther! I&rsquo;m done fer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin had stepped out of the folds of
the curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, there!&rdquo; he blurted. &ldquo;What are youse up
to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howly Saint Pathrick! I&rsquo;m gone now, sure!&rdquo;
groaned Phelan, and trembled where he stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Officer 666,&rdquo; laughed Gladwin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
only your ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan exhaled a tremendous sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord be praised if it ain&rsquo;t yez!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
delightedly. &ldquo;But where did ye get that
disguise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a hair store&ndash;&ndash;Madam Flynn&rsquo;s on Avenue A&ndash;&ndash;do
you like it?&rdquo; laughed the young man. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t want any of my friends or neighbors to recognize
me, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But fer the love o&rsquo; heaven where have yez been
all the time?&rdquo; asked Phelan, sinking into a chair and
breathing hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patrolling my beat&ndash;&ndash;I mean your beat,&rdquo; returned
the young man, &ldquo;and keeping my eye out for my
friend the burglar. Oh, I&rsquo;ve had quite a party.
When I got hungry I sent to the Plaza for lunch
and sat on the park wall and ate it. And, by the
way, I saw a friend of mine coming along in an
automobile and I arrested him for speeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Phelan exploded, jumping to his feet and
turning white as his boiled shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, nabbed him for breaking the speed limit,&rdquo;
Gladwin nodded, leaning back against a table and
lighting a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer, fer, fer breakin&rsquo; the speed limit; fer, fer&ndash;&ndash;yez
made an arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! He was going so slow he deserved to
be arrested, and what&rsquo;s more, he was making love
to a pretty girl without shame. I got in and told
him to drive me to the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan threw up his hands with a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; did yez take him to the station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I?&rdquo; chuckled Gladwin. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know where it was&ndash;&ndash;that is, your station&ndash;&ndash;so I told
him most any would do. We rode about a bit and
as he didn&rsquo;t seem anxious to be locked up, I compromised
for fifty dollars. It was really quite simple,
Phelan, and if I&rsquo;d only had more time I might
have got back that five hundred.&rdquo;</p>

</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost me me job&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve
done!&rdquo; moaned Phelan, while his brain reeled with
pictures of police headquarters, trial rooms and ruthless
commissioners. &ldquo;Come, give me me uniform,&rdquo;
he cried, with a sudden accession of passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the young man, quickly,
his grin vanishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me uniform!&rdquo; rasped Phelan, with a rush toward
the young man. &ldquo;Give me me uniform an&rsquo; let
me git out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin dodged around the table, protesting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&ndash;&ndash;not yet. The burglar&ndash;&ndash;that is, my
friend&ndash;&ndash;will be here any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend?&rdquo; Phelan stopped, again a prey to
bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes&ndash;&ndash;I explained all that before. The one
I&rsquo;m playing the joke on. You don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;m
going to take it off now, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yez can bet your life, yez are,&rdquo; roared Phelan,
with another savage rush round the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had enough of this, an&rsquo; too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just a minute,&rdquo; pleaded Gladwin. &ldquo;I assure
you everything is all right, and I&rsquo;m not going
to leave the house again. If anything happens so
you need your uniform I&rsquo;ll be right here where you
can get it. I&rsquo;m not going to leave the house. Tell
me, where&rsquo;s Barnes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Phelan, more calmly, and pausing
in his pursuit.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My friend&ndash;&ndash;the one I left here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno&ndash;&ndash;there was a ring at the bell here a
while ago and in come a wild woman and&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! I hope my friend wasn&rsquo;t scared off!
If that fellow was to meet her here at 10.30&ndash;&ndash;why,
it&rsquo;s after that now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Phelan, quick&ndash;&ndash;help me put these covers
on the chairs and things. Over there in the corner,
back of the chest. He mustn&rsquo;t know that anybody&rsquo;s
been here. Hurry, man; hurry! we haven&rsquo;t
a second to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan submitted to the breathless commands as
if he were hypnotized, puffing and blowing like a porpoise
as he struggled to slip the linen covers over the
chairs. Gladwin worked at top speed, too; and just
as he was covering the great chest he gave a start
and held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a motor stopping
outside. You go down into the kitchen and be ready
to come up if you hear me whistle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ye&rsquo;ll promise yez won&rsquo;t leave the house with
them clothes,&rdquo; gasped Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&ndash;&ndash;certainly not. Be quick now&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll switch
off this light and step out on the balcony. Close
that door tight after you and be sure you switch out
the lights in the back hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin only waited for the disappearance of
Phelan and the soft closing of the door when he
plunged the room into darkness. He could hear the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
click of a key in the front door lock as he groped
his way to the window curtains and pressed back
into the semi-circular recess that led out onto a window
balcony. As he did so he unlatched the heavily
grilled balcony window, drew out his penknife and
slit a peephole in the curtain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>GLADWIN MEETS HIMSELF.</h3>
</div>
<p>Standing as stiff and immovable as if he had been
turned to stone, Travers Gladwin peered with one
eye through the narrow aperture he had slashed in
the heavy brocade porti&egrave;re. Still gazing into inky
darkness he could hear the cautious tread of two
persons. His senses told him that one of the visitors
was a heavy, sure-footed man and that the other
was of lighter build and nervously wary. His deductions
ceased instantly as a flash of light crossed
his vision.</p>
<p>For a moment the concealed watcher saw nothing
save the incisive ray of light that cut like a knife
thrust through the darkness; then as he followed
the shaft of light to its source he made out the silhouette
of a man in evening dress&ndash;&ndash;a white shirt
front, square shoulders that branched off into the
nothingness of the cloaking shadows and a handsome,
sharp profile that lost itself in the gloom of a silk
hat.</p>
<p>He also made out a cane from which the flashlight
beamed. It was a new device to the experience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
of Travers Gladwin, and he watched it with the
same fascination that a man is wont to manifest in
the gleam of a revolver muzzle that suddenly protrudes
itself from the mysterious depths of night.</p>
<p>The wielder of this smart burglar&rsquo;s implement did
not move as he gashed the darkness with the ray of
light, and to Gladwin he seemed inordinately calm.
His companion was somewhere behind him, groping,
and did not come into the picture until suddenly he
found the push button in the wall and switched on
the full glare of the electroliers suspended from the
ceiling.</p>
<p>Gladwin saw and recognized. He drew in a deep
breath of surprise.</p>
<p>It was Watkins, the thieving butler he had discharged
in London. His attention did not linger
on this familiar soft-shuffling tool of the master thief,
however, but snapped back to the big, good looking
young man with the branching shoulders and erect,
confident carriage.</p>
<p>Used as he was to immaculate exteriors, Travers
Gladwin had never seen a better groomed man. He
had never seen a man with a quicker eye and more
unconscious grace of movement.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that bitter envy gnawed his
heart for a little while as there rose again before him
the picture of that bewilderingly pretty girl and her
passionate insistence that she would elope with
&ldquo;Travers Gladwin&rdquo; in spite of any and all obstacles.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>That underneath all these splendid sheathings the
man had the mean spirit of a deceiver and a robber
never entered the young man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>But presently things began to happen with such
avalanching rapidity of action that there was not
even a second to spare for speculation upon the vast
gap between their social positions.</p>
<p>The lights had hardly been switched on before the
big fellow put the sharp query to his companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watkins, is this room just as you left it when
you went away with Mr. Gladwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; replied Watkins, with characteristic
deference of tone. &ldquo;Bateato, the Jap, closed
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the other, laying his cane and hat on
a table and drawing from the pocket of his light overcoat
a blue print diagram of the house. Casting his
eyes about the room, he unfolded the diagram and
pointed to it, nodding his head behind him for Watkins
to come and look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in this room now,&rdquo; he said, easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out that way is the corridor to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the panel-like door which a few
minutes before had swallowed the very much undressed
Officer 666.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s no other way out save through the
front door or by way of this balcony behind those
curtains?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; still running his finger over the diagram,
&ldquo;on the floor above are Gladwin&rsquo;s apartments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, at the head of the stairs&ndash;&ndash;first door to
the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, very good,&rdquo; slipping the diagram back into
his pocket and lifting his eyes to the great portrait
of the ancestral Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly and with palpable
relish, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a Stuart! Is that the great-grandfather,
Watkins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; responded Watkins, without any of his
companion&rsquo;s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; with the same grim emphasis, and off came
the overcoat to be carelessly tossed across his hat and
stick. His eye fell upon the great antique chest by
the wall.</p>
<p>He lifted the lid to inspect its void interior. Glancing
up above it, he motioned to Watkins and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, help me get this out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watkins glided to one end of the chest and together
they hauled it clear of the wall. This done,
he addressed Watkins as if he were but a creature to
command:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can manage alone in here, but I want to be ready
to leave by the time Miss Burton arrives. You go
outside and wait in the car&ndash;&ndash;and keep a sharp lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watkins bowed himself out with his stereotyped,
&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and the door clicked gently after him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>The now lone invader returned to his interested
survey of the paintings that covered the walls, turning
easily on his heel until his line of vision embraced
&ldquo;The Blue Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his difficult peephole Travers Gladwin could
see the sharp, stern features wrinkle with smiles before
the intruder laughed lightly and breathed with
seeming great enjoyment:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! The Blue Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile went out as swiftly as it had come and
was replaced by an utterly different expression as he
swung about and visualized the Rembrandt on the
wall above where the great empty chest had stood.</p>
<p>There was reverence and quick admiration in every
feature as he bowed and exclaimed with a long sigh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rembrandt! Rembrandt! God!&ndash;&ndash;to paint like
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emotions of this remarkable young man came
and went with the quickness of his eye.</p>
<p>While still in the act of outpouring his admiration
he whipped from the tail of his dress coat a flat fold
of a dozen or more sheets of wrapping paper, shook
them out and laid them on the lid of the chest.</p>
<p>With another swift gesture he produced a knife,
sprang the thin gleaming blade and walked up to the
Rembrandt.</p>
<p>He raised the knife to the canvas with the ease
of a practiced hand, when he heard a movement behind
him, and turned his head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>Travers Gladwin had stepped from the sheltering
screen of porti&egrave;res and stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>Whatever shock this sudden apparition of a uniformed
policeman was to the man caught in the act
of cutting a priceless canvas from its frame he managed
to conceal by taking tight grip of every muscle
in his body.</p>
<p>His eyes revealed nothing. There was no rush of
color to or from his face. His first change of expression
was to smile.</p>
<p>Dropping the arm that poised the knife, he let himself
down easily from tiptoe and turned squarely
to Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Officer,&rdquo; he said without a tremor,
showing his teeth in as engaging a smile as Travers
Gladwin had ever looked upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evenin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said Gladwin, shortly, with an admirable
affectation of Phelan&rsquo;s brogue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find something on the balcony that interests
you?&rdquo; said the other slowly, still holding his
smile and his amazingly confident bearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You climbed up there to enjoy the moonlight, perhaps?&rdquo;
he added, even more softly, gaining reassurance
from the wooden expression that Gladwin had
forced upon his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not the moonlight,&rdquo; responded the uniformed
similitude of Officer 666, &ldquo;the other light. I seen
&rsquo;em go on. This house has been closed for months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, to be sure,&rdquo; the other shrugged. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
most alert, Officer&ndash;&ndash;right on the job, as they say.
I congratulate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been watching this house ever since Mr. Gladwin
went away,&rdquo; said Gladwin slowly, unable to make
up his mind whether to call Phelan or to continue
the intensely interesting dialogue.</p>
<p>His visitor decided the situation for him by coolly
lighting a cigar, taking a few deliberate puffs and
turning it over in his fingers to inspect it as if it were
the only object worth attention in the room.</p>
<p>Gladwin read this elaborate by-play for what it
was worth&ndash;&ndash;an effort to decide just how best to play
his part&ndash;&ndash;and was pleasantly thrilled with the realization
that he himself was so well disguised in the uniform
of Officer 666.</p>
<p>So he clung to his own r&ocirc;le and forgot Michael
Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the invader, reflectively. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very
good of you, Officer. Let me offer you this as a
slight token of my appreciation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His left hand slid into his trousers pocket and
brought up a roll of bills. His nonchalance was a
perfect mask as he stripped off one of the bills and
held it out carelessly to Gladwin.</p>
<p>On his part, Gladwin&rsquo;s expression was superbly
blank as he reached for the bill, pocketed it and said
with his purring brogue:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, sorr! And might I ask who ye are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; chuckled the other, now thoroughly
master of himself and utterly confident.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who do you suppose, Officer, would come
to the front door&ndash;&ndash;unlock it&ndash;&ndash;walk in and turn up
the lights?&ndash;&ndash;a thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do sometimes,&rdquo; said Gladwin, cocking his
head to one side with an air of owlish wisdom.</p>
<p>The other raised his eyebrows to express surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they really?&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;You amaze me,
Officer. I&rsquo;ve always supposed they broke in somehow
and used dark lanterns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said Gladwin, obstinately.</p>
<p>The big man shrugged his shoulders contemptuously,
puffed his cigar for a moment and said indulgently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry, Officer, to deprive you of the
pleasure you would evidently derive in catching a
thief and making an arrest. Now,&rdquo; with a light
laugh, &ldquo;who might you imagine I was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I wasn&rsquo;t sure Mr. Gladwin was across
the Atlantic I&rsquo;d imagine that yez were Mr. Gladwin
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said with such laborious canniness that
the thief made haste to discover just how the land
lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re sure Mr. Gladwin is abroad, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see be the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A real hearty laugh escaped this time, and he added
brightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Policeman, I&rsquo;ll tell you something to
help you make a good shrewd guess&ndash;&ndash;<i>Mr. Gladwin
is not abroad</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then yez are Mr. Gladwin, sorr!&rdquo; cried the
young man eagerly, as if delighted at the discovery.</p>
<p>The other leaned back against the table, crossed
one foot over the other and said musingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found me out, Officer&ndash;&ndash;I must admit it. Permit
me to thank you again for looking out for my
house, and if you don&rsquo;t mind I&rsquo;ll double this little
reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the roll of bills came out and another $20
gold certificate was gathered in by Officer 666, who
grinned as he took it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, sorr!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gesture with which this second benefaction
was bestowed was a gesture of dismissal and the bestower
set off on an easy saunter about the room,
humming a tune.</p>
<p>Officer 666 did not move, and after a moment the
other casually remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to be in any hurry to get back to
your post, officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sorr&ndash;&ndash;I ain&rsquo;t in no hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a cigar, then,&rdquo; and one was offered with
the same assumption of good-natured indifference that
had accompanied the tender of the bribes. Gladwin
accepted the cigar, took off his cap, dropped it in
and returned the cap to his head.</p>
<p>The thief was puzzled for a moment, until it occurred
to him that it would suit his purpose best to
have this thick-skulled copper in his company rather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
than have him go outside and discuss the matter with
a more shrewd superior. Therefore he said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, officer, could you be spared off your rounds
for, say, an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, sorr; I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want you to do me a favor. I&rsquo;ll pay you
well for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look to me like a chap who could keep a
secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part o&rsquo; me trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Well, then, I&rsquo;m expecting a call from a
lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see, sorr,&rdquo; and Gladwin forced another
fatuous grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; said the other, impressively.
&ldquo;This lady is my fianc&eacute;e.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s your business, sorr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin was beginning to enjoy the battle hugely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; explained the thief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
about to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yez are about to be married!&rdquo; with a slight
wince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to be married to-night&ndash;&ndash;secretly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so? Well, I can&rsquo;t help yez about that,
can I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you can, because I want it kept quiet on
the lady&rsquo;s account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll help you keep it quiet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
<i>on the lady&rsquo;s account</i>!&rdquo; with an emphasis that got away from him,
but was misinterpreted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; and out came the roll of bills again and
another yellow boy was slipped into the greedy palm
of Officer 666.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sorr. But what can I do, sorr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you later on. In the mean time help
me take the covers off this furniture and make the
place look habitable. Hurry now, for I haven&rsquo;t much
time. That&rsquo;s the idea&ndash;&ndash;brisk. Switch on the hall
lights&ndash;&ndash;you can find the button. Then go upstairs
and straighten my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin stopped in his activities as if he had run
against a wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your room, sorr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the head of the stairs, first door to the
left. Then come back here and help me pack.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>MISADVENTURES OF WHITNEY BARNES.</h3>
</div>
<p>Just as it had not occurred to Travers Gladwin
to ask Michael Phelan to define the limits of his beat
along Fifth avenue so it happened that Whitney
Barnes went forth in search of his friend without
even the vaguest notion of where he might be found.</p>
<p>It is doubtful if young Mr. Barnes knew what a
policeman&rsquo;s beat was. Certainly he did not conceive
of it as a restricted territory.</p>
<p>He had gone about six blocks at his best stride,
eagerly scanning both sides of the avenue before
the thought came into his mind that he might be
going in the wrong direction and that he might keep
on indefinitely to the Staten Island ferry and obtain
never a glimpse of the borrowed uniform of Officer
666.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must warn the chap,&rdquo; he thought fiercely,
&ldquo;or there will be the very deuce and all to pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney slowed down, came to a full stop and was
meditatively chewing the head of his cane when an
automobile halted at the curb. A head thrust itself
out of a window of the limousine and a musical voice
asked:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Barnes, what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes guiltily jumped and barely missed
swallowing his cane.</p>
<p>Volplaning to earth, he looked for the source of
this dismaying interruption. He recognized with a
start one of the past season&rsquo;s d&eacute;butantes whose mamma
had spread a maze of traps and labyrinths for
him&ndash;&ndash;Miss Sybil Hawker-Sponge of New York,
Newport, Tuxedo and Lenox.</p>
<p>Before he could even stutter a reply a motor footman
had leaped down from the box and opened the
door of the limousine. Miss Hawker-Sponge fluttered
out, contrived her most winning smile and repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Barnes, what are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her big doll eyes rolled a double circuit of coquetry
and slanted off with a suggestive glance at the massive
doorway of the Hawker-Sponge mansion, one
of the most aristocratically mortgaged dwellings in
America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather late for a call,&rdquo; she gushed suddenly,
&ldquo;but I know mamma&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried Barnes. &ldquo;That is&ndash;&ndash;I beg your
pardon&ndash;&ndash;I should be charmed, but the fact is I was
looking for a friend&ndash;&ndash;I mean a policeman. Er&ndash;&ndash;you
haven&rsquo;t seen a good looking policeman going by,
have you, Miss Sybil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the coquetry in Miss Hawker-Sponge&rsquo;s eyes
went into stony eclipse.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking for a policeman friend, Mr.
Barnes?&rdquo; she said icily, gathering up her skirts and
beginning to back away. &ldquo;I hope you find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her back with the abruptness of a
slap in the face.</p>
<p>In another moment he was again a lone wayfarer
in the bleak night wilderness of out-of-doors Fifth
avenue.</p>
<p>Indubitably he had committed a hideous breach of
good manners and could never expect forgiveness
from Miss Hawker-Sponge. She had really invited
him into her home and he had preferred to hunt for
a &ldquo;policeman friend.&rdquo; Yet the tragedy of it was so
grotesquely funny that Whitney Barnes laughed, and
in laughing dismissed Miss Hawker-Sponge from his
mind.</p>
<p>He must find Travers Gladwin, and off he went at
another burst of speed.</p>
<p>He covered about three blocks without pause.</p>
<p>A second and far more sensational interruption
came from a side street, and again of the feminine
gender.</p>
<p>It was a tall, weird looking figure wound in a black
shawl and it bumped squarely into Whitney Barnes
and brought him up sharply, spinning on one foot.</p>
<p>Before he stopped spinning he felt himself seized
by the arm.</p>
<p>Without warning a bundle was thrust into his arms
and he had to clutch it. In another instant the weird
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
figure had fled up the avenue, turned a corner and
vanished.</p>
<p>Instantly the bundle that Whitney Barnes held
awkwardly and painfully, as if it were a firebrand,
emitted an anguished wail.</p>
<p>If that wasn&rsquo;t a pretty pickle for Whitney Barnes!
His cane had clattered to the pavement and he did
not dare stoop to pick it up. The anguish from the
bundle he held increased terrifically in volume. He
could feel beads of perspiration running down his
face.</p>
<p>What in desperation was he going to do with that
awful bundle? He knew intuitively that the tall,
shawled figure would never return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be arrested as the
father of it, and what will Sadie say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no wonder that the son and heir of Old
Grim Barnes sweated. It wasn&rsquo;t perspiration. One
doesn&rsquo;t perspire in such awful straits&ndash;&ndash;one sweats,
like a navvy.</p>
<p>It seemed ages before he could form the impulse
to move in any direction for any definite purpose.
He was on the point of making up his mind to lay
the bundle on the doorstep when he sensed a heavy
step from behind and was paralyzed by the gruff
ejaculation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be damned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes twisted his head and beheld a big, deep-chested
policeman&ndash;&ndash;a haughty domineering policeman&ndash;&ndash;who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
showed in every inch of him that the gods
had anointed him above the mere ranks of mortal
patrolmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it! take it!&rdquo; cried Barnes, extending the
bundle toward the uniformed presence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
mine,&rdquo; he almost shrieked. &ldquo;A woman gave it to
me&ndash;&ndash;and I have a very important engagement and
must hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant McGinnis&ndash;&ndash;for &rsquo;twas none other&ndash;&ndash;drew
back and waved the bundle from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute, my young friend,&rdquo; he spoke through
one side of his large mouth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hold that infant
till its mother comes or you&rsquo;ll go with me to
the police station and tell your story to the captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; wailed Barnes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to
find a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A policeman, eh? Well, here&rsquo;s one for you, and
a sergeant at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean a friend. It&rsquo;s horribly important. I&rsquo;ll
give you anything you ask if you&rsquo;ll only take this
howling bundle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None o&rsquo; that, young feller,&rdquo; McGinnis snapped
him up. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll give me nothing and you&rsquo;ll come
sharp and straight to the station. Now I know
there&rsquo;s something back o&rsquo; this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; Barnes objected. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s most
horribly important that I should find&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chop it! Chop it! You&rsquo;ll come with me, and
you&rsquo;ll lug that infant. If you won&rsquo;t come quiet I&rsquo;ll
slip the nippers on you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>Barnes realized the hopelessness of the situation
and looked about him wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that taxicab, officer,&rdquo; he urged, as he saw
one of the vehicles approaching. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t walk like
this. I&rsquo;ll pay the fare&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll pay everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McGinnis consented to this arrangement. The taxicab
stopped. A few minutes later it bore the sergeant,
his prisoner and the still howling infant to the
threshold of the East Eighty-eighth street police station.</p>
<p>McGinnis consented to carry the infant as they
got out and once inside the station lost no time in
turning it over to the matron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, McGinnis,&rdquo; said Lieut. Einstein from the
desk; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>McGinnis explained in a few crisp sentences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the captain in, Lieutenant?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;This
young fellow is after trying to bribe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barnes protested that such a thought had never
entered his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply told him,&rdquo; he declared hotly, &ldquo;that I had
an important engagement&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for a policeman, he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a friend. I may have said policeman&ndash;&ndash;I may
have said anything in such a beastly situation. I am
sure that when the captain hears me he will understand
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be true, sir,&rdquo; said the lieutenant politely,
&ldquo;but the captain is out at present and won&rsquo;t be back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
till after midnight. If you want to, you can sit in
the back room and wait for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further protestations were unavailing. With a sigh
of despair Barnes permitted himself to be led to the
back room, where he dropped down on a chair and
looked savagely about him.</p>
<p>The room was empty and there was nothing to
gaze at save four blank walls and a black cat sitting
in a corner idly washing its paws. Now and then a
door opened, a face peered in and the door shut again.
Somewhere a clock ticked dolefully.</p>
<p>An hour passed while the young man sought in
vain to enchain his incoherent thoughts. He could
think of nothing vividly. He could recall nothing
at all.</p>
<p>Whenever the wail of that infant the matron was
caring for reached him he writhed and ground his
teeth.</p>
<p>In this sad plight he remained until a door near
him opened and a man in plain clothes came stealthily
in. He walked straight to Barnes, bent down and
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got a hundred-dollar bill about you drop
it onto the floor and walk out. The lieutenant won&rsquo;t
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The individual turned on his heel and went out the
way he had come. He did not shut the door tightly
behind him. Barnes felt that an eye was watching
through the slit, so he lost no time in jumping to his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
feet, getting his money out of his wallet and dropping
two one-hundred-dollar bills on the floor.</p>
<p>This done, he jammed the wallet back in his pocket,
picked up his cane and gloves and opened the door
through which he had entered the room. He started
warily forward with his eyes straight ahead. He
could feel that the lieutenant who sat behind the high-railed-off
desk was the only person in the room and
he could hear the scratch of his busy pen.</p>
<p>Gaining the street entrance, he drew an immense
sigh of relief, opened it eagerly and fairly leaped outside
to the steps. As the door shut behind him he
thought he heard a sudden explosive laugh, but it
meant nothing to him as he hurried along blindly,
increasing his pace at every stride.</p>
<p>At the corner of Third avenue he stopped and
consulted his watch. It was midnight!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>AN INSTANCE OF EPIC NERVE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Travers Gladwin scaled the great staircase three
steps at a time. Stumbling against a divan he threw
himself across it and lay for a few moments stretched
on his back with every muscle relaxed. He felt as
if he had been buffeted by mighty tempests and overwhelmed
by cataclysms. His head throbbed with
fever and he felt a sickening emptiness inside.</p>
<p>How was he going to avert the catastrophe of an
elopement and at the same time save himself and that
charming young girl from a shrieking scandal? There
didn&rsquo;t seem any coherent solution. If Whitney Barnes
had only remained with him&ndash;&ndash;at least to lend
him moral courage!</p>
<p>Where had the confounded ass gone? Why didn&rsquo;t
he return? A fine friend in need was he!</p>
<p>There was no time to unravel his perplexities and
lay any definite plan. He must act, taking his cue
as it was presented to him by the racing events of the
moment.</p>
<p>He got up from the divan and rushed downstairs.
He cleared the last landing, with a momentum that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
slid him across the polished floor of the hallway after
the manner of small boys who slide on ice. He fairly
coasted into the room, but his precipitate intrusion
did not in the least disturb his visitor.</p>
<p>During Gladwin&rsquo;s brief absence that supernaturally
composed individual had cut the Rembrandt from the
frame and laid it on one of the sheets of wrapping
paper he had spread out on the chest. He had also
cut out a Manet, a Corot and a Vegas&ndash;&ndash;all small
canvases&ndash;&ndash;and hung them over the back of a chair.</p>
<p>As the owner of these masterpieces skidded into
the room the thief was taking down a Meissonier,
frame and all, fondling it tenderly and feasting his
eyes on the superb wealth of detail and the rich crimson
and scarlet pigments in the tiny oblong within
the heavy gilt mounting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Officer, you are back,&rdquo; he said easily, as Gladwin
staggered against a table and gripped it for support.
The methodical despoiler did not so much as
turn his head as he placed the Meissonier on the
chest and deftly cut out the canvas. His back was
still squared to the flabbergasted young man as he
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, get busy, Officer, if you are going to help
me. Take down that picture over there on the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed, and went on wrapping up the immensely
valuable plunder.</p>
<p>Gladwin got up on a chair and reached for one
of the least noteworthy of his collection.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&ndash;&ndash;not that one,&rdquo; said the thief, sharply,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the
one above,&rdquo; an old Dutch painting that had
cost a round $10,000.</p>
<p>The young man took it down gingerly, biting his
lips and cursing inwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he was rewarded, &ldquo;bring it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin managed to cross the room with an appearance
of stolid indifference and as he handed the picture
to the &ldquo;collector&rdquo; he said haltingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it these pictures is worth a lot of money,
sorr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I take it,&rdquo; said the other with a
laugh, beginning at once to slash out the canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sorr, I mean, <i>you take it</i>!&rdquo; said Gladwin
viciously. The wrathful emphasis missed its mark.
The &ldquo;collector&rdquo; was humming to himself and working
with masterful deftness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that woman&rsquo;s head to the left,&rdquo; he commanded
as soon as he had disposed of the Dutch
masterpiece. &ldquo;And be quick about it. You move as
if you were in a trance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin saw that he was to take down his only
Rubens, wherefore he deliberately reached for another
painting, &ldquo;The Blue Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not that thing!&rdquo; exclaimed the &ldquo;collector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with this one, sorr,&rdquo;
snapped back Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fake,&rdquo; said the other, contemptuously. &ldquo;I
paid two old frauds five hundred pounds for that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
thing in London a couple of years ago&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s absolutely
worthless from the standpoint of art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin looked at him in open-mouthed amazement
and slid from the chair to the floor.</p>
<p>How had this astounding person come by the secret
of &ldquo;The Blue Boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a positive awe in Gladwin&rsquo;s gaze as he
sized up the big man&ndash;&ndash;again from his shining patent
leather shoes to his piercing eyes and broad, intellectual
forehead. He fairly jumped when the command
was repeated to take down the Rubens and
hand it to him. As he handed it over he stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of this one, sorr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; said the other, in pitying disgust.
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a Rubens&ndash;&ndash;worth $40,000 if it&rsquo;s worth
a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yez don&rsquo;t tell me,&rdquo; Gladwin managed to articulate.</p>
<p>Indicating the full length portrait of the ancestral
Gladwin, he added, &ldquo;Who is that old fellow over
there, sorr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly don&rsquo;t refer to the subject of that portrait
as fellow,&rdquo; the other caught him up. &ldquo;That is my
great-grandfather, painted by Gilbert Charles Stuart
more than a century ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You monumental liar,&rdquo; was on Gladwin&rsquo;s lips.
He managed to stifle the outburst and ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are yez goin&rsquo; to take all these pictures away with
yez to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not all of them,&rdquo; was the careless reply.
&ldquo;Only the best ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unspeakably kind of him!&rdquo; thought the unregarded
victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If yez wanted the others,&rdquo; he said with fine sarcasm,
&ldquo;I could pack &rsquo;em up afther ye&rsquo;re gone an&rsquo; sind
thim to yez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be a good idea, Officer&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll think
it over,&rdquo; the pilferer thanked him.</p>
<p>Then he went on with his task of taking the back
out of the mounting of the Rubens, showing that he
did not trust his knife with such an ancient and priceless
canvas.</p>
<p>Gladwin was thinking up another ironic opening
when the door bell rang. He jumped and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the lady, sorr, I&rsquo;ll go and let her in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you wait here,&rdquo; the other objected. &ldquo;She
might be frightened at the sight of a policeman&ndash;&ndash;you
stay here. I&rsquo;ll let her in myself,&rdquo; and he strode
swiftly out into the hallway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH THE HERO IS KEPT ON THE HOP.</h3>
</div>
<p>Travers Gladwin watched the big handsome mis-presentiment
of himself disappear into the hallway
with every nerve at full strain.</p>
<p>As he heard the door open, then a delighted feminine
cry and the unmistakable subtle sound of an
embrace, he ground his finger nails into his palms
and bit his lips. Every fibre of him burned with
jealous hatred of this impostor.</p>
<p>If there had been only more of the brute left in
the Gladwin strain undoubtedly there would have
been a sensational clash between the two men for the
benefit of the beautiful young girl who, Gladwin
strove to acknowledge, was the helpless pawn of circumstances.
But the refinements of blood rob the
physical man of his savage resources and impose a
serious hamper upon his primordial impulses.</p>
<p>Helen came into the room with the thief&rsquo;s arm
about her waist while Gladwin stood dumbly at attention,
his features hardened and inscrutable.</p>
<p>At sight of his uniform and failing to recognize
him in his disguise the girl turned pale and uttered
a frightened exclamation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, dear,&rdquo; the man at her side reassured
her, smiling down upon her, &ldquo;this is only
officer&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He looked up with a laughing expression
of inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murphy, sorr,&rdquo; responded Gladwin, through
tightly compressed lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the pretender nodded quickly. &ldquo;Murphy,
Officer Murphy, my dear&ndash;&ndash;looks after my house when
I&rsquo;m away. He is one of the city&rsquo;s best little watchmen
and he is going to see that everything is made
safe and secure after we have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen breathed an exclamation of relief, but the
fright in her eyes lingered as the unconscious feeling
struck in that the attitude of the policeman seemed
more than a trifle strained.</p>
<p>She carried a little grip in one hand, which the
bogus Gladwin took from her and handed to the real
Gladwin, nodding significantly for him to leave the
room. Turning to Helen, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did you bring the bag, dear? My man
told me he found your trunk at the Grand Central
Station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helen answered, &ldquo;but auntie insisted that
I go to the opera, so I had to pack my travelling
dress. I slipped out of the opera during the entre
act, and went home to change my gown. I was so
frightened and in such a dreadful state of nerves that
I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shudder ran through her and she seemed on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
the point of breaking down when the man with whom
she had chosen to elope drew her to him and said
with what had every expression of genuine tenderness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, dear! Calm yourself. Why, you&rsquo;re
trembling like a leaf. There is nothing to be frightened
about now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She yielded to his embrace and he bent down his
head to kiss her on the lips.</p>
<p>Whatever he projected in the nature of an enduring
osculation was spoiled as Gladwin dropped
the bag to the floor with a crash.</p>
<p>The man looked up angrily and the girl gave a
frightened cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, officer?&rdquo; the thief
shot at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sorr,&rdquo; said Gladwin, with mock humility,
turning away his head to hide his emotions.</p>
<p>As the girl shrank from his arms the thief switched
his attention from Officer 666 and led her to a chair,
resuming his gentle tones. He pressed her to sit
down, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just packing up some pictures. I shan&rsquo;t
keep you waiting long. Now, that&rsquo;s good; you&rsquo;re
getting calmer. You&rsquo;re all right now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es, Travers dear,&rdquo; she responded with an effort,
looking into his face. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t break down,&rdquo;
she went on, with a nervous laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stronger
than I look. I&rsquo;ve made my mind up to it. The
trouble is that my heart won&rsquo;t behave. It&rsquo;s beating
terribly&ndash;&ndash;just feel it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>He was about to place his hand on her heart when
Gladwin was seized with a paroxysm of coughing.
The thief straightened up and turned scowlingly
upon the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the matter with you, McCarthy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murphy, sorr,&rdquo; Gladwin retorted. &ldquo;Me throat
tickled me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the other sharply, &ldquo;if you would
move around as I told you, your throat wouldn&rsquo;t tickle
you. Get something to pack these paintings in.
There isn&rsquo;t anything in this room&ndash;&ndash;go upstairs and
get a trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where there is none, sorr,&rdquo; Gladwin
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, look around for one&ndash;&ndash;a small empty trunk,
and be quick about it.&rdquo; He spoke with crackling emphasis.</p>
<p>Stung to the quick by the overbearing insolence of
this command, it required a prodigious effort for the
young man to control his voice. He said with difficulty:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking, sorr&ndash;&ndash;suppose&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;trunk&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;full?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thief squared his broad shoulders and walked
threateningly toward Gladwin. He stopped directly
in front of the young man and said through his teeth,
slowly and deliberately and without raising his voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the trunks are full&ndash;&ndash;now listen carefully, because
I want you to understand this&ndash;&ndash;if the trunks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
are full, then empty one. Do you get my meaning?
Take the fullness out of it, and after you have done
that and there is nothing more left in it, then bring
it down here. Now do you think you get my idea
clearly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sorr,&rdquo; said Gladwin, dully, feeling that there
was no way out of the situation for the moment save
to obey. Strive as he might he could not wholly shake
off the influence of this splendid big animal&rsquo;s dominating
will power.</p>
<p>And if it affected him that way he didn&rsquo;t wonder
at the spell the man had cast upon the impressionable
and sentimental Helen.</p>
<p>He left the room with a sudden spurt and swiftly
mounted the stairs, the chief object of his haste being
to prevent an extended interview in his absence
and a resumption of tender dialogue.</p>
<p>He had scarcely gone when the spurious Gladwin
turned again to the girl with his most engaging smile
and softest tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, dear,&rdquo; with a sweeping gesture that included
his work of spoilation, &ldquo;I am taking your advice&ndash;&ndash;packing
only the most valuable ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, Travers,&rdquo; said Helen, rising from
her chair and coming toward him with all her impulsive
love and confidence restored, &ldquo;that I am giving
you a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble!&rdquo; he cried, with the gushing effusiveness
of a matin&eacute;e idol. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bringing a great joy into
my life.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>He took her hand and caressed it, adding with
the true lover&rsquo;s frown of perplexity, &ldquo;But are you
going to be happy, dear? That&rsquo;s what you must think
of now&ndash;&ndash;before it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a magnificent bluff and carried with deadly
aim. The girl stopped him passionately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not stop to talk about that now&ndash;&ndash;there
isn&rsquo;t time. We must hurry, dear, and get away before
auntie finds out and comes after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll come here?&rdquo; he asked slowly,
while his forehead wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid Sadie will tell her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie&ndash;&ndash;your cousin? H&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made no effort to conceal that he was thinking
rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d rather postpone it after all, Travers?&rdquo;
she said quickly, while the color rushed to her
cheeks and her lips trembled. &ldquo;If you only thought
it best I&rsquo;d like to tell auntie what I&rsquo;m going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;; he retorted. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;ve
gone over all this before. It must be this way, or not
at all. Which is it to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you my word, you know,&rdquo; she said
under her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my brave little girl!&rdquo; he cried with a burst
of feeling, reaching out his arm to embrace her.</p>
<p>Crash! Bang! Biff! Slam! Bam!</p>
<p>There burst into the room Officer 666, entangled
in the lid and straps of an empty trunk. It was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
steamer trunk and not very heavy, but Travers Gladwin
was far from adept in baggage smashing.</p>
<p>He had wasted so much time in hunting for the
trunk that he had sought to make up for the delay
by executing what resembled an a&euml;roplane descent.</p>
<p>At the final twist of the staircase the trunk had
mastered him and charged with him into the room.
As he lay sprawled on the floor with a foolish grin
on his face, the discomfited lover turned on him with
a voice of fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officer, what the deuce is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The intense savagery of his tone made the girl
shrink away from him and turn pale. He managed
to cover his break so quickly with a forced laugh and
an effort to assist Gladwin to his feet that her fear
was only momentary.</p>
<p>In the last stage of his downward flight Gladwin
glimpsed that he had dropped in barely in time to
spoil another touching scene. With a grin of sheer
delight, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll I put the trunk, sorr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The self-styled Gladwin pointed to the right of
the chest and set to work to gather up his few hundred
thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of pelf. He was about
to place the flat packages in the trunk when he turned
to Helen and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see any others that you&rsquo;d like me to take,
dear?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know best,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Only I should
think that you would take some of the miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The miniatures?&rdquo; he asked, raising his eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;They are the loveliest I&rsquo;ve
ever seen and they&rsquo;ll hardly take up any room at all.
If we are going to be away such a long time I think
it would be safer to take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was palpable to Travers Gladwin that the big
chap had received a psychic jolt, for his hand trembled
a little as he laid down the canvases on the top
of the chest and addressed the girl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;d seen the miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, when I was here this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took this between the eyes without flinching.
His voice was marvellously steady as he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were here this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; she asked in a puzzled tone. &ldquo;How
funny! You&rsquo;d just gone out when I called, but two
of your friends were here and one of them showed
me the miniatures, and china, and plate and lots of
things. Why, I left a message for you about the
opera&ndash;&ndash;didn&rsquo;t they tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stood with her back to Gladwin and the
man she addressed slowly turned his head and glanced
over her head with a keen, flashing look of inquiry.
Gladwin lifted his chin a little and met the look without
change of expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they tell you, Travers?&rdquo; the girl repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; they told me,&rdquo; he said hastily, still maintaining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
his fixed gaze upon Gladwin. There was
barely an instant&rsquo;s pause before he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officer, kindly go up to my room and see if you
can find a bag and pack enough things to last a week
or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sorr.&rdquo; Gladwin flung out of the room.</p>
<p>He started noisily up the stairs until he saw that the
thief had turned his back to him, whereat he vaulted
the banister and dropped lightly upon a divan in a
recessed niche that could not be seen from the room
he left.</p>
<p>The moment Gladwin vanished the thief turned to
Helen and asked sharply:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did you see my friends here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little after five,&rdquo; replied the girl, recoiling
slightly with a look of dismay, for there was a new
raw edge to the sharpness of his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell them about the elopement?&rdquo; he said
less harshly, but with a scarcely veiled eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they knew all about it,&rdquo; Helen hastened to
reply, searching his face apprehensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knew about it?&rdquo; he mused, fairly grinding his
brows together under the pressure of his agitated
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell them?&rdquo; he queried steadily,
measuring her fresh, young beauty and vowing to
himself that whatever struggle impended he was
going through with it to the limit of his resources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we were to meet here,&rdquo; she answered with
increasing fear.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That we were to meet <i>here</i>?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at half-past ten&ndash;&ndash;oh, was it something
I shouldn&rsquo;t have told them?&rdquo; she cried, coming toward
him.</p>
<p>Once more Officer 666 snapped the tension. He
had wriggled around the staircase and found the suitcase
Bateato had packed and left for him. Hating
to play the r&ocirc;le of an eavesdropper any longer than
necessary he made a flying start and burst into the
room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>GLADWIN COMES OUT OF HIS SHELL.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What the&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The spurious aristocrat and art collector suppressed
his torrid exclamation. The impulse moved him to
seize the uniformed butter-in and pitch him through
the nearest window. He was big and powerful
enough to do it, too.</p>
<p>In the furious glance he got, Travers Gladwin
read a warning that in an earlier stage of his career
would have made him feel mighty uncomfortable.
Now he liked the smell of danger and met the message
of wrath without a flicker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;ve got there?&rdquo; the thief, having
mastered himself, asked, pointing to the grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the bag you asked for, sorr,&rdquo; drawled Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you to pack it,&rdquo; said the other, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All packed, sorr. Hunting clothes, shirts, ties,
socks&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He looked up with a boyish grin and the big chap
was stumped for a moment. The thief said slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take it up to my room and unpack it.&rdquo; It
was his turn to grin.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;What, sorr?&rdquo; asked the dismayed Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t want these things after all,&rdquo; came the
velvety rejoinder. &ldquo;Unpack it carefully and bring
it back here. And kindly be more careful of the
stairs when you come down&ndash;&ndash;one step at a time,
<i>please</i>! Now, what are you waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin withdrew reluctantly, stealing a glance at
Helen as he sidled through the curtained doorway.
Her eyes never left the face of the man she thought
she loved, but whose character was being swiftly revealed
to her in a new light.</p>
<p>That resourceful individual waited only for the
blue uniform to pass through the porti&egrave;res, when he
sprang forward and reached out on both sides for
the heavy mahogany folding doors. He brought
them together swiftly and softly, then ripped down
the porti&egrave;res from the pole, flinging one to the left
of the door and the other across the chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen, Helen,&rdquo; he cried, seizing her roughly
by the shoulder. &ldquo;It may be that we will have to
get out of here in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-w-hy, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she stammered,
wincing at the crushing grip of his hand.</p>
<p>He replied with a swift rush of words that fairly
stunned her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your aunt may find it out and try to stop us.
Now I shall be on the lookout, but I want you to do
everything I tell you&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll see if the coast is clear in
case we have to go out the back way. In the meantime
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
I want you to wrap these pictures for me. I
wouldn&rsquo;t ask you, dear, only we haven&rsquo;t a minute
to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He darted across the room and opened the narrow
door that led into the backstairs corridor. Helen
stared stupidly after him until he disappeared and
then turned toward the chest and went to work wrapping
up the precious canvases like one in a trance.
She had scarcely started when the folding doors
opened noiselessly and Bateato stuck in his head.</p>
<p>Fearing that some harm had come to his master
the little Jap had left the Ritz and sprinted all the
way to the Gladwin mansion. He was breathless and
wild-eyed, yet he had entered the house as silently
as a breath of air.</p>
<p>Peeking into the room Bateato noted the ripped-down
porti&egrave;res and devastated picture frames. His
Oriental mind told him but one thing&ndash;&ndash;robbery.
Seized with a violent spasm of loyalty to his master
he brushed into the room and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatz thees? Oh, hell&ndash;&ndash;damn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen was in too good training by this time to
swoon, though she wanted to. She started back in
alarm and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how you startled me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato circled round her like an enraged rat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no fool me&ndash;&ndash;I know you tief&ndash;&ndash;you steal
picture&ndash;&ndash;I get pleece&ndash;&ndash;much pleece&ndash;&ndash;whole big lot
pleece, quick.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>He headed for the door.</p>
<p>Helen pursued him, crying: &ldquo;See here! Wait a
minute! You don&rsquo;t understand! Mr. Gladwin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jap was gone and the hall door slammed after
him before she had reached the folding doors. In
another instant Travers Gladwin, who had been making
a vain hunt for a revolver in the upper part of
the house came flying down the stairs and assailed
the frightened girl with another overwhelming shock.</p>
<p>Seeing she was alone he threw himself into the
breach headlong:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Helen, just a moment. I&rsquo;ve been waiting
for a chance to speak to you. You must get away
from here at once. Do you understand&ndash;&ndash;at once!
Don&rsquo;t waste time talking&ndash;&ndash;go quick while you have
a chance. You mustn&rsquo;t be mixed up in what&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl felt that her heart would burst with its
palpitations of fear, but she was incapable of flight.
Her limbs seemed like leaden weights. Some force
working without the zone of her mental control made
her stammer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-ho are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; the young man raced on, &ldquo;and you must
believe what I say&ndash;&ndash;this man you came here to meet
and elope with is not Travers Gladwin at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She expressed her horrified disbelief in a frozen
stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he pursued passionately. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
imposter! The real Travers Gladwin you met here
this afternoon. He was I; that is, I was he. I mean
I am Travers Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;only I&rsquo;ve got this uniform
on now. It is only on your account that I have not
caused his arrest and a sensation. I can&rsquo;t have you
mixed up in a nasty scandal. I want to save you&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t
you see I do?&ndash;&ndash;but I can&rsquo;t wait much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe what you are saying! I can&rsquo;t believe
it! Oh, it&rsquo;s too horrible!&rdquo; sobbed Helen, clinging
to a fragment of her shattered idol as a drowning
man clings to a straw.</p>
<p>Gladwin was on the point of resuming his appeal
when he sensed a heavy tread. He had divined that
the picture thief had left the room to reconnoitre
emergency exits or to learn whether or not the house
was surrounded. He had hoped that he might run
into Michael Phelan, but did not stop to puzzle out
why this had not happened. Backing to the door,
he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming&ndash;&ndash;question him. That&rsquo;s all I ask.
I&rsquo;ll be waiting to see that you get out in safety&ndash;&ndash;trust
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wriggled backward and disappeared through
the folding doors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h3>A VISIT TO THE EXILED PHELAN.</h3>
</div>
<p>But where, oh, where was the exiled Phelan when
the bogus Gladwin went on his backstairs investigation?
Puzzled as he was by the fast moving events
of the night, stripped of the uniform of his authority,
still his police instincts should have warned him of
this new character in his dream.</p>
<p>Michael Phelan, however, was busy&ndash;&ndash;busy in a
way one little would suppose.</p>
<p>As the gentlemanly outlaw entered the kitchen,
Phelan was standing on the tubs of the adjoining
laundry, his face almost glued to the window-pane
and his eyes uplifted to the fourth story rear window
of a house diagonally opposite, through which he
could observe a pantomime that thrilled him.</p>
<p>It was late, well past bedtime even for the aristocratic
precincts of New York. Yet there was going
on behind that brilliantly lighted window a one-man
drama strangely and grotesquely wide-awake.</p>
<p>A first casual glance had conveyed the impression
to Phelan that a tragedy was being enacted before
his eyes&ndash;&ndash;that murder was being done with fiendish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
brutality, and he&ndash;&ndash;Phelan&ndash;&ndash;powerless to intervene.</p>
<p>The seeming murderer was a man of amazing obesity,
a red-faced man with a bull neck and enormous
shoulders, clad in pink striped pajamas and a tasselled
nightcap of flaming red.</p>
<p>Back and forth the rotund giant swayed with
something in his arms, something which he crushed
in his fists and brutally shook, something which he
held off at arm&rsquo;s length and hammered with ruthless
blows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The murtherin&rsquo; baste!&rdquo; ejaculated Phelan as he
switched off the one light he had been reading by and
darted into the next room to get a better view from
the summit of the kitchen tubs.</p>
<p>Suddenly the mountain of flesh and the debile victim
that he was ruthlessly manhandling disappeared
from view. For several long thundering seconds the
petrified Phelan could see nothing save a dancing
crimson tassel, the tassel attached to the nightcap.
Surely a mighty struggle was going on on the floor!</p>
<p>Phelan did not hear the light step upon the kitchen
stair or the stealthy tread of the big man in evening
dress as he pussy-footed his way to the kitchen
door leading out into the back yard and found that
it was easily opened.</p>
<p>Every sentient nerve in Michael Phelan&rsquo;s being
was concentrated in his eyes at that moment and it
is highly doubtful if he would have heard a fife and
drum corps in full blare enter the kitchen. He heard

nothing and saw nothing below that upward focal
angle.</p>
<p>The man Phelan should have heard flashed the
light in his cane only at infrequent intervals. He
did not aim its bright revealing beam into the half
open door of the adjoining laundry and he was as unconscious
of the proximity of Phelan as that unfrocked
or de-uniformed officer was of the invader.
He returned to Miss Helen Burton in complete
ignorance of the fact that the lower regions of the
dwelling were otherwise than empty.</p>
<p>But the second he re-entered the room he saw the
girl was strangely agitated and that she feared to
look at him. Laying down his cane he crossed the
room to her side and said in his softest tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you haven&rsquo;t got on very fast in your packing,
have you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen was leaning against the back of a chair,
feeling she was surely going to topple over in a
swoon. Summoning all her reserve of nerve power,
she strove to reply naturally:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&ndash;&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t quite understand how to pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was at her side now and seized both her
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Helen, what&rsquo;s the matter? Your hands
are cold as ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke warmly and tenderly, while at the same
time his eyes were everywhere about the room and
he was listening with the wary alertness of a rodent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>There was more than a little of the rat in the soul
inclosed in this splendid envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing&ndash;&ndash;only I&rsquo;m faint,&rdquo; she said tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That policeman has been talking to you&ndash;&ndash;hasn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has,&rdquo; she blurted, with a catch in her
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you who he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He measured out each word and conveyed the
sense. &ldquo;Did he tell you who he pretended to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl responded, scarcely above a whisper.</p>
<p>He took her by the shoulders and turned her
squarely toward him, looking down into her face
with frowning eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Helen, I want you to tell me the truth&ndash;&ndash;the
truth, you understand? I shall know it even if
you don&rsquo;t. Who did he say he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeling of repugnance took possession of the
girl and she shook herself free and stood back. Her
body had warmed into life again and she looked
steadily into his eyes as she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travers Gladwin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He needed all his great bulk of flesh and steel-fibred
nerve to fend off this shock. Not the remotest
fancy had crossed his mind that Travers Gladwin
might be in New York. It was with a palpably
forced laugh that he ejaculated:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Travers Gladwin! Oh, he did, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl had read more than he imagined the
sudden contraction of his features and dilation of his
eyes had revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to tell me the truth&ndash;&ndash;you must!&rdquo; she
said passionately. &ldquo;<i>Who are you?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man who loves you,&rdquo; he let go impulsively.
The desire to possess her had sprung uppermost in
his mind again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you the man you pretended to be&ndash;&ndash;are
you Travers Gladwin?&rdquo; she insisted, compelled
against her convictions to grope for a forlorn hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I were not?&rdquo; he cried, with all the dramatic
intensity he could bring to voice. &ldquo;If instead of
being the son of a millionaire, a pampered molly-coddle
who never earned a dollar in his life&ndash;&ndash;suppose
I were a man who had to fight every inch of the
way&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>He stopped. His alert ear had caught a sound in
the hallway. He sped noiselessly to the folding door
and forced one back, revealing Officer Murphy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he said threateningly, and Gladwin
came in a little way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that bag?&rdquo; said the thief, with a glare
and a suggestive movement with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bag, sorr?&rdquo; said Gladwin, feeling that for
the moment discretion was the better part of valor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you brought in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me to unpack it, sorr. It&rsquo;s upstairs,
sorr.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get it. Go now&ndash;&ndash;and don&rsquo;t waste time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin went, determined this time that he must
arm himself with some weapon, even if it were one
of the rusted old bowie knives of his grandfather
that ornamented the wall of his den. He estimated
accurately that he would prove a poor weak reed in
the hands of that Hercules in evening dress, and
while the thought of a knife sickened him, he was
impelled to seek one.</p>
<p>As he mounted the stairs the thief strode to the
table near the window and gathered up Helen&rsquo;s opera
cloak and handed it to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, go quickly,&rdquo; he urged; &ldquo;my car is just across
the street. There is no time to argue your absurd
suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; retorted Helen, accepting the
cloak and backing away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you believe that man?&rdquo; he asked reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I do,&rdquo; she said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll show you mighty quick you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo;
he cried, as a crowning bluff. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably some
spy sent by your aunt. I&rsquo;ll get my man in here and
will have him arrested after you and I have gone.
Wait here&ndash;&ndash;I shan&rsquo;t be a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the door slammed after him Helen ran to the
window and then back to the door. She was now
terribly alarmed on another score. She feared to
go out and she feared to remain in the house. She
feared physically&ndash;&ndash;feared violence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>Travers Gladwin had found the bowie knife and
slipped it into his trousers pocket. Then he had
gone down the stairs on the run. As he entered the
room and saw that the man had gone he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he running away&ndash;&ndash;and without his pictures or
his hat and coat. What&rsquo;s his game, I wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming back&ndash;&ndash;he says my aunt sent you
here,&rdquo; said Helen, but less afraid at his return to
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what he says,&rdquo; Gladwin returned,
gesturing excitedly. &ldquo;You must go home&ndash;&ndash;now.
To-morrow you can learn the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I go out he&rsquo;ll be sure to see me,&rdquo; she
protested.</p>
<p>Gladwin looked about him and thought a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see that little alcove back of the stairs,&rdquo;
he said quickly, pointing. Helen crossed the room
and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, hide in there,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;The curtains
will conceal you. If he and his man come back
I&rsquo;ll get them in this room&ndash;&ndash;then I&rsquo;ll press this button,
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He indicated a button and added: &ldquo;That rings a
buzzer; you can hear it from the alcove, and then
slip out the front door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl paused but an instant, then fled to the
place of shelter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH BLUFF IS TRUMPS.</h3>
</div>
<p>Having disposed of the girl for the moment,
Travers Gladwin decided it was time to call Michael
Phelan to his assistance. There was no telling what
this amazing crook might do now. He was too
much for him. That a thief and impostor could
possess such superhuman nerve had never occurred
to his untutored mind. He was a perfect dub to
have let the situation reach such a stage of complexity,
though the one thought uppermost in his mind
was to save Helen from public ridicule and contempt.</p>
<p>He had reasoned it out that just the uniform of
Officer 666 would serve him almost as a magician&rsquo;s
wand. He had almost counted on the thief taking
one craven look at his constabulary disguise and then
leaping through the window&ndash;&ndash;fleeing like a wolf in the
night&ndash;&ndash;he, Travers Gladwin, remaining a veritable
hero of romance to sooth and console Helen and
gently break the news to her that she had been the
dupe of an unscrupulous criminal. Instead of which&ndash;&ndash;he
ground his teeth, went to the little panel door
and shouted Phelan&rsquo;s name.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>Mrs. Phelan&rsquo;s son came a-running.</p>
<p>He had been on his way. The vast girthed individual
in the pink striped pajamas and tasselled
nightcap had accomplished his awful purpose, but
the climax had been anti-climax and Phelan had
ground his teeth in rage.</p>
<p>He had been on the point of bursting through
the window and somehow scrambling aloft to the
rescue of that helpless being who was being ground
and wrenched and pounded by that porcine monster,
when the monster suddenly rose to view again with
a dumb-bell in each hand.</p>
<p>The jaw of Officer 666 slowly dropped as he
watched the manipulation of the dumb-bells. There
was no passion in the stodgy movements of the great
paddy arms. Even so far away as he was Phelan
could see that the man puffed and blew and that his
vigor was slowly waning. Then suddenly the huge
man stooped and held up in plain view a dangling
wrestling dummy.</p>
<p>The lone watcher swallowed a savage oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure &rsquo;twas exercisin&rsquo; an&rsquo; not murther he was
doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Phelan hissed through his teeth.</p>
<p>His anger was white hot. Again he had been the
victim of delusion and had wasted heroic emotions
on a stuffed dummy that served merely as an inanimate
instrument in a course of anti-fat calisthenics.</p>
<p>Every nerve in Phelan&rsquo;s body was fairly a-bristle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
as he made his way upstairs and burst into the great
drawing-room and picture gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer the love o&rsquo; hivin,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;give me me
uniform and let me out o&rsquo; here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your uniform; I&rsquo;ve had enough of it,&rdquo;
replied Gladwin, throwing him the coat and cap,
&ldquo;and get into it quick. There&rsquo;s work for you right
in this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not, nor play neither,&rdquo; snapped Phelan.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go out and chase up a drunk or throw
a faint or git run over or somethin&rsquo; desperate to
square mesilf with the captain. I&rsquo;m an hour overdue
at the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll square yourself with the captain all right
if you just do what I tell you,&rdquo; said Gladwin eagerly,
helping him on with his coat and pushing him
toward the window recess. &ldquo;You go right in there
behind those curtains and wait till I call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan took one look at the young man&rsquo;s face
and muttered as he obeyed. &ldquo;This must be a hell
of a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then the thief breezed in again, jerking
back on his heels as he caught sight of Gladwin
<i>sans</i> uniform, <i>sans</i> moustache and <i>sans</i> eyebrows.
But a glance at that young man meant volumes and
there was no limit to his spontaneous resources. He
summoned a laugh and jerked out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;ve resigned from the force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; retorted Gladwin, &ldquo;and let me tell you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
that this little excursion of yours has gone far
enough. I&rsquo;ll give you one chance&ndash;&ndash;get away from
here as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big fellow curled one corner of his lip in a
contemptuous smile, then glanced about him quickly
and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the young lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the young lady,&rdquo; Gladwin flung
back at him. &ldquo;It was only on her account that I
let you go as far as this. Now get out and keep
away from that young lady&ndash;&ndash;and drop my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sneering smile returned and balancing himself
easily as he looked down on Gladwin, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, son&ndash;&ndash;easy. I don&rsquo;t like to have little boys
talk to me like that,&rdquo; and turning to the doorway
behind him he beckoned. The obedient Watkins
sidled in and stopped with head averted from Gladwin,
who started with surprise at seeing him.</p>
<p>Stepping forward and making sure there could be
no mistake, Gladwin turned to the thief and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, now I understand how you knew all about
my house. This is what I get for not sending this
man to jail where he belonged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother with him, Watkins,&rdquo; snarled the
big fellow, as he noted his companion&rsquo;s complexion
run through three shades of yellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to bother with him,&rdquo; he went
on, and reaching out he caught Travers Gladwin by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
the shoulder and whirled him half way across the
room.</p>
<p>The young man spun half a dozen times as he
reeled across the carpet and he had to use both
hands to stop himself against a big onyx table. As
he pulled himself up standing he saw that Watkins
had lifted the trunk on his shoulders and was headed
for the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phelan!&rdquo; he gasped out. &ldquo;Here, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officer 666 came out with the snort and rush of
a bull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that man,&rdquo; cried the thief, pointing to Watkins,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s trying to get out of here with a trunkful
of pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s hair-trigger mind had thought this out
before Phelan was half way round the table. One
lightning glance at the thickness of the patrolman&rsquo;s
neck and the general contour of his rubicund countenance
had translated to him the sort of man he had
to deal with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&ndash;&ndash;here&ndash;&ndash;put down that trunk,&rdquo; spluttered
Phelan, brandishing his club at Watkins. Watkins
dropped the trunk and at a signal from his companion
was gone. Swiftly and silently as he vanished,
he could not have been half way to the door
before the thief urged Phelan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick&ndash;&ndash;go after that man&ndash;&ndash;he&rsquo;s a thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop Phelan!&rdquo; cried Gladwin, who had begun to
see through the pantomime. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re both thieves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan tried to run four ways at once.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-what?&rdquo; he gurgled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trick to get you out of the house,&rdquo; said
Gladwin with his eyes on the big man, who was
calmly smiling and who had fully made up his mind
on a magnificent game of bluff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the blazes kind of a joke is this?&rdquo; blurted
Phelan, looking from one to the other in utter bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s no joke, officer,&rdquo; said the bogus
Gladwin sharply&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;not if he gets away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it&rsquo;s not so funny yourself,&rdquo; cut in the
real Gladwin. Then to Phelan, &ldquo;Arrest this man,
Phelan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; asked the astonished Phelan,
sizing up the thief as the highest example of aristocratic
elegance he had ever seen in the flesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I mean it,&rdquo; Gladwin shot back. &ldquo;Look
out for him&ndash;&ndash;there he goes for the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thief had started in that direction, but his
purpose was not escape. The idea had flashed upon
him that Helen might be concealed there. Phelan
headed him off, whereupon the thief said severely, in
a tone that was far more convincing that Gladwin&rsquo;s
most passionate sincerity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now be careful, officer, or you&rsquo;ll get yourself
into a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him bluff you, Phelan,&rdquo; cautioned Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet your life I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Phelan answered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
though he was already bluffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick close to
yez,&rdquo; he faltered, inching uncertainly toward the
thief.</p>
<p>He had come close enough for that astute individual
to make out that he wore the same uniform
young Gladwin had been masquerading in and he
made capital of this on the instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you think it is going to look,&rdquo; he said,
impressively, &ldquo;if I prove that you&rsquo;ve tried to help a
band of thieves rob this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A band of thieves?&rdquo; Phelan&rsquo;s jaw dropped wide
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying to you,&rdquo; cried Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said a band of thieves,&rdquo; insisted the thief.
&ldquo;Why he&rsquo;s got his pals hidden all over the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you he&rsquo;s lying to you,&rdquo; Gladwin cut in
frantically, seeing that Phelan was falling under the
spell of the big man&rsquo;s superb bluff, and at the same
time remembering Helen and pressing the button in
the wall to warn her that the time had come for her
to flee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re the only ones in this house,&rdquo; Gladwin
pursued, as Phelan gave him the benefit of his pop-eyes
before he yielded them again to the stronger
will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ve all escaped,&rdquo; said the thief, easily,
thrusting his hands in his pockets to help out his
appearance of imperturbability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let one go out, Phelan, and there were two
others beside this one.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></div>
<p>The buttons on Phelan&rsquo;s coat were fairly undulating
with the emotions that stirred within him. In
his seething gray matter there stirred the remembrance
that Bateato had told him that women were
robbing the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the women,&rdquo; he said, ignoring Gladwin
and addressing the thief. &ldquo;I remember&ndash;&ndash;when the
little Japanaze called me oft me beat, he said there
was women crooks here, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying to you, Phelan,&rdquo; persisted Gladwin,
though with less vehemence, a great feeling of relief
having visited him in the belief that Helen had
made her escape. &ldquo;You can have the whole place
searched just as soon as you&rsquo;ve got this man where
he can&rsquo;t get away. There are no women here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last declaration had scarcely passed his lips
when a woman&rsquo;s voice raised in hysterical protest
was audible in the hallway.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<h3>BATEATO SUMMONS BIG MUCH POLICE.</h3>
</div>
<p>A vitagraph film of Bateato&rsquo;s journey to and
from the police station would consist of a series of
dark brown blurs. If you have ever noticed a mouse
in full flight you will have some idea of how that
Jap ran. He knew where the police station was,
too, for he had been there once when his brother,
Itchi Comia, was arrested for assaulting a Russian
peddler.</p>
<p>If the little Jap had only coursed through another
street things might have gone somewhat differently
in the Gladwin household, for he would have encountered
Whitney Barnes hurrying in the opposite
direction, and that young man would very likely have
prevented him from going to the station.</p>
<p>But there was absolutely no obstacle in Bateato&rsquo;s
way until he reached the station house, and the only
obstacle he encountered there was a serious impediment
in his speech.</p>
<p>Police Captain Stone had returned to barracks a
few minutes after the departure of Barnes and a few
minutes before the arrival of Bateato. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
standing beside the lieutenant&rsquo;s chair when the Jap
sped in, and he seemed almost interested (for a police
captain) at the extraordinary manifestations of
emotion in Bateato&rsquo;s countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All pleece&ndash;&ndash;quick&ndash;&ndash;robbers&ndash;&ndash;thieves&ndash;&ndash;ladies!&rdquo;
began Bateato, then paused and made wild
jabs above his head with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy as a nut,&rdquo; said the lieutenant in an undertone
to the captain, and the captain nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All pictures&ndash;&ndash;thieves&ndash;&ndash;steal ladies!&rdquo; was Bateato&rsquo;s
second instalment, and the captain and lieutenant
looked at each other and shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big much pleece!&rdquo; shrieked Bateato, made some
more motions with his hands and rushed out into
the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jap whiskey,&rdquo; said the captain, musingly,
utterly unimpressed. &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t crazy. That Jap
whiskey&rsquo;s awful stuff. They licked the Russian army
on it. He&rsquo;ll run it off. If you ever see a Jap runnin&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll know what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato ran a block and then stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell damn!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;I no tell where
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran back to the station and burst in again with
even more precipitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I no tell house,&rdquo; he rattled off. &ldquo;Mr. Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;Travers
Gladwin. Big lot white house&ndash;&ndash;Fifth
avenue&ndash;&ndash;eighty, eighty, eighty. Quick&ndash;&ndash;thieves&ndash;&ndash;ladies!&rdquo;
and he was gone again before Captain Stone
could remove his cigar from his face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>The captain looked at the lieutenant and the lieutenant
looked at the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he ain&rsquo;t drunk, Captain,&rdquo; ventured the
lieutenant. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that Gladwin house on the
books. It&rsquo;s marked closed and there&rsquo;s a note about
a million-dollar collection of paintings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain thought a moment and then burst
into action:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call the reserves and get the patrol wagon,&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;I remember that Jap. I guess there&rsquo;s
something doing. I&rsquo;ll go myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the reserves were all asleep and the horses had
to be hitched to the patrol wagon Bateato had a big
start of his big much pleece.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the breathless condition in which
he had arrived at the station house, his return journey
was accomplished at his dizziest speed. Also
he arrived back at the house way in advance of Whitney
Barnes. There was a reason.</p>
<p>Wearing a frock coat and a silk hat and carrying
a cane (of course he called it <i>stick</i>) one is hardly
equipped for marathoning. And if you must know
more, Whitney&rsquo;s small clothes were too fashionably
tight to permit of more than a swift heel and toe
action. At this he was doing admirably in his passionate
haste to return and warn his friend Gladwin
when another woman came into his life and appealed
for succor.</p>
<p>Three in one evening, when he was perfectly satisfied
to stop at one&ndash;&ndash;the bewitching Sadie.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>No. 3 was of an entirely different type from No. 1
and No. 2, and, happily for Whitney, there was no
yowling bundle this time&ndash;&ndash;merely a cat, and a silent
cat at that.</p>
<p>She was a plump little woman and rather comely
and she was intensely excited, for the cat in the case
was hers and the cat was up the only tree on that
street east of Central Park. At the foot of the tree
sat a large bulldog gazing fixedly up at the cat.</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes was so occupied with his heel and
toe pace that he did not descry the woman or the
dog or the tree or the cat until the woman seized
him by the arm and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must save my darling Zaza from that dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she tailed off into hysterical sobs, but did
not release her grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I&rsquo;m in great haste,&rdquo; retorted Barnes,
striving to wriggle free from her grip. &ldquo;I would advise
you to call a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no policeman,&rdquo; sobbed the distressed
mistress of Zaza. &ldquo;Oh, you m-m-m-must s-s-s-save
my Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-aza. Oo-oo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Barnes glimpsed the dog and its fang-filled
grin as it stared up at the cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect me to tackle that dog?&rdquo; he
asked, backing away and making another effort to
free himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him! do anything to him!&rdquo; insisted the distressed
female. &ldquo;Oo-oo-oo! he kills cats. Do something
quick or I must scream.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>Whitney Barnes would have welcomed an open
manhole to vanish into. If that woman screamed
and held fast to him till the police came it would
be just as bad as the baby case. But if he tackled
the dog he would probably go to the hospital and be
afflicted with hydrophobia and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself my dear woman,&rdquo; he said frantically.
&ldquo;The dog cannot climb the tree and your cat
is perfectly safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are y-y-y-you s-s-s-sure?&rdquo; she moaned. Then
grabbing him tighter. &ldquo;But you must not leave me.
In case the dog should go up that tree you must attack
it with your cane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; panted Barnes, &ldquo;if you will only release
your grip on my arm. Your finger nails are
tearing the flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I w-w-w-will not hold you so tight,&rdquo; she consented,
&ldquo;but I must hold on to you till somebody
comes. Oh, look at that brute. He is biting the
tree. He&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the sudden clangor of a patrol wagon and the
hammering of steel-shod hoofs on the cobbles caused
the owner of Zaza both to cease her shrill lamentations
and let go of Whitney Barnes&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>The patrol wagon was rolling down behind them
at a furious pace while its gong rent the stillness of
the night as a warning to all crooks and criminals to
beware and to scurry to shelter. It is the New York
brass band method of thief hunting and if that patrol
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
wagon gong hadn&rsquo;t broken before the vehicle had
crossed Madison avenue the destinies of several prominent
personages might have been seriously hampered
in their headlong fling.</p>
<p>That gong kept blaring its clang of warning long
enough to frighten off the dog and restore Whitney
Barnes to freedom, and once released from the bruising
grip of that distraught little woman he turned
his back upon Zaza&rsquo;s fate and ran&ndash;&ndash;he ran so long
as he considered it feasible to maintain the integrity
of his trousers. That is, he ran not quite a block,
then dropped back to his heel and toe exercise and
swiftly ate up the distance that separated him from
Travers Gladwin&rsquo;s home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h3>PHELAN LOSES HIS BRIBE.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was merely a coincidence that Bateato should
drag Helen back into the room just as Gladwin had
gone on record with the declaration, &ldquo;There are no
women here,&rdquo; but it was a sufficiently dramatic coincidence
to jar from Officer No. 666 the exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the divil are they all springin&rsquo; from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato had come up with Helen as she was descending
the stoop, had seized her by the wrist and
almost swung her off her feet as he swept her back
into the house and rounded her up before the three
men, dumb with fright and barely able to stand.
Still gripping her wrist, Bateato let go the Maxim
volley:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tief! She try get away, but Bateato catch
fast&ndash;&ndash;she tief&ndash;&ndash;I see steal all pictures&ndash;&ndash;she&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bateato, you idiot!&rdquo; his master hurled at him with
a menacing gesture that caused the little Jap to drop
the girl&rsquo;s hand and jump back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to stay at the hotel?&rdquo; continued
Gladwin, fiercely, for the moment ignoring
both Phelan and the thief.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I &rsquo;fraid&ndash;&ndash;much late you no come. Bateato
come back see girl steal all pictures!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Jap had fallen into Phelan&rsquo;s state of
blind bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; his master snapped him up, walking
up to him with an eat-&rsquo;em-alive expression. &ldquo;And
now listen&ndash;&ndash;I don&rsquo;t want you to say anything more,
understand? Not a word to anybody about anything.
Not a syllable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I no spick,&rdquo; bleated the Jap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that you don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;not a single word&ndash;&ndash;if you
do I&rsquo;ll skin you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never in the three years he had served the young
man had Bateato seen him in anything like this savage
state of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spick no more for noting not nobody quick!&rdquo;
he promised, and his hand clasped over his mouth
like a vise.</p>
<p>Having corked Bateato in this wise, Gladwin
turned to Helen, who stood as if rooted to the floor,
staring straight ahead of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;Everything
is all right.&rdquo; He took her arm to reassure her
and then spoke to Phelan, who had been making a
vain effort to solve the mix-up and didn&rsquo;t feel quite
sure that he wasn&rsquo;t bewitched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Phelan,&rdquo; said Gladwin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain the
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to God ye would!&rdquo; said Phelan from the
bottom of his heart.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This lady&rsquo;s being here is all right&ndash;&ndash;and she isn&rsquo;t
connected with this affair in any way. I&rsquo;ll prove that
to you readily enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, go ahead.&rdquo; And Phelan crossed his eyes
in an effort to include in the focus both Gladwin and
the thief de luxe, whose splendidly groomed appearance
impressed him the more.</p>
<p>On his part the thief was leaning carelessly against
a cabinet looking on with the expression of one both
amused and bored. What he had noticed most was
that Helen kept her eyes averted from him as if
she feared to look at him and that she had palpably
transferred her allegiance to Gladwin. When she
had recovered some of her self-control she followed
that young man&rsquo;s words eagerly and obeyed his
slightest signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will explain to you, Phelan, as soon as I see this
young lady started for home,&rdquo; Gladwin ran on, and
proceeded with Helen toward the entrance to the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! Yez&rsquo;ll not leave this room,&rdquo; Phelan
stopped them, his suspicions again in a state of conflagration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I only want&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what yez want,&rdquo; Phelan snorted,
blocking the way. &ldquo;Yez&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well&ndash;&ndash;just as you say,&rdquo; returned the young
man desperately, &ldquo;but I will have to ask my man to
escort this lady out and put her in a taxicab. Bateato&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Bad Pertaters &rsquo;ll stay where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan was visibly swelling with the majesty of the
law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very disagreeable,&rdquo; Gladwin charged him;
then to Helen, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry I cannot go with
you, but I think you can find the way yourself. Just
go out through the hall, and&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll stay right here with the rest o&rsquo; yez,&rdquo; was
Phelan&rsquo;s ultimatum, as he squared himself in the
doorway with the heroic bearing of a bridge-defending
Horatius.</p>
<p>The only member of that tense little tableau who
really had anything to fear from the spectre of the
law embodied in the person of Officer 666 had waited
for Gladwin to play his poor hand and, conceiving
that this was the psychological moment, sauntered
across the room and said with easy assurance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officer, if there&rsquo;s anything further you want of
me, you&rsquo;ll have to be quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yez&rsquo;ll wait here, too, till I can communicate with
headquarters,&rdquo; Phelan gave him back, not liking the
tone of command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then hurry up, because it won&rsquo;t go well with you
if I am detained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t yez threaten me!&rdquo; exploded Phelan.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doin&rsquo; me duty by the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Threaten you! Why, I can show you that you
have been helping to rob my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a new current of thought&ndash;&ndash;a sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
inspiration&ndash;&ndash;but this peer of bluffers managed to
crowd a volume of accusation in the slow emphasis
with which he said it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your house!&rdquo; gasped Phelan, rocked clear off the
firm base he had scarcely planted himself on. &ldquo;What
do ye mean&ndash;&ndash;who are yez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose I am? Travers Gladwin,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the fear-numbed Helen Burton was startled
into animation by this amazingly nervy declaration
and half rose from the chair she had been guided
to and forced into by Gladwin when she seemed on
the verge of swooning at Phelan&rsquo;s refusal to permit
her to depart.</p>
<p>Phelan expressed wonder and alarm in every feature
and his arms flopped limply at his side as he
muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travers Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;youse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t listen to him, Phelan,&rdquo; cried Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Phelan turned on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came home to-night,&rdquo; the thief pressed
his advantage, &ldquo;this man was here&ndash;&ndash;robbing my
house, dressed in your uniform&ndash;&ndash;yes, and you yourself
were helping him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; whined the distressed Phelan,
yielding himself utterly to the toils of the master
prevaricator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you did it intentionally&ndash;&ndash;but why
did you do it?&rdquo; the thief let him down with a little
less severity of emphasis.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He said he wanted to play a joke. He&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be an idiot, Phelan,&rdquo; interposed Gladwin,
putting his foot in it at the wrong time and
receiving as his reward from the policeman a savage,
&ldquo;Close your face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, playing a joke, was he?&rdquo; said the thief, smiling.
&ldquo;And did he offer you money. Now, no
evasion&ndash;&ndash;you had better tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; gulped Phelan, with murder in one
eye for the real Gladwin and craven apology in the
other for the impostor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you took it?&rdquo; sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, officer! Shame! Shame!&rdquo; in tones of
shocked reproach. &ldquo;Let me see what he gave you&ndash;&ndash;come
now, it&rsquo;s your only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan hesitated, gulped some more, and at last
produced the bill.</p>
<p>The thief took it from his trembling but unresisting
hand, unfurled it, turned it over, held it up
close to his eyes and suddenly laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you certainly are easy&ndash;&ndash;<i>counterfeit</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; roared Phelan, and Travers Gladwin
joined him in the exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you swear that man gave you this bill?&rdquo; cut
in the thief, sharply, snatching out a pencil and marking
the gold certificate across the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, sorr!&rdquo; shouted Phelan. &ldquo;I will, an&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well! Now you see this mark in the corner&ndash;&ndash;will
you be able to identify it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sorr.&rdquo; Phelan was fairly grovelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the thief, and nonchalantly shoved
the bill into his waistcoat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Phelan,&rdquo; protested Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kape your mouth shut&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d just like to take wan
punch at yez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan meant it and took a step toward Gladwin
when the thief stopped him and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, officer, is there anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;I got to get the patrol
wagon here some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Bateato had entered into an inflexible contract
with himself not to utter another syllable before the
break of day at least he might have eased Phelan&rsquo;s
mind on that score and informed him that something
ominously like a patrol wagon was rounding the corner
at that moment. And if the art collector had not
been so keenly amused at his facile conquest of the
gullible bluecoat his alert ears might have warned
him to say something entirely different from this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d call the wagon for you, officer, only I&rsquo;m
afraid these people might overpower you and get
away with that trunk of pictures. You see what a
nice mess they&rsquo;ve been making of my picture gallery.
Why, if I hadn&rsquo;t happened in to-night they would
have walked off with half a million dollars&rsquo; worth
of paintings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call the wagon, Mr. Gladwin,&rdquo; returned
Phelan, grimly. &ldquo;I kin handle the lot of o&rsquo; them an&rsquo;
ten more like them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, officer, but be very careful&ndash;&ndash;I shan&rsquo;t
be long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And turning with a mocking bow to Travers Gladwin,
he sauntered out into the hallway and walked
into the arms of Police Captain Stone and ten reserves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<h3>BATEATO KEEPS HIS PROMISE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Although the escaping thief was brushed back
into the room rather rudely and Travers Gladwin
cried out as he caught sight of the uniformed officer
and his men, &ldquo;By Jove, captain, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve
come,&rdquo; the consummate bluffer did not bat an eyelash
or manifest the merest symptom of fear, stepping
easily to one side and watching for the coming of
his cue with feline alertness.</p>
<p>For a moment Captain Stone devoted himself only
to the distribution of his men, posting them at all
the windows and doors. When he was satisfied that
every avenue of escape was covered he turned to
Phelan with the sharp query:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this, Phelan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught them trying to get away with Mr. Gladwin&rsquo;s&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was by the luckiest chance,&rdquo; broke in
Travers Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. Gladwin?&rdquo; the captain stopped him,
curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the other one, captain,&rdquo; replied Phelan, indicating
the thief; whereupon that gentleman bowed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, captain, I&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; the real Gladwin started
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done well here, Phelan,&rdquo; the captain
complimented him, ignoring the young millionaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, sorr,&rdquo; blushed Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say he has done well.&rdquo; The thief came
forward, with an approving nod toward the now
ecstatic Officer 666.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been for him,&rdquo; pursued the thief,
&ldquo;these thieves would have carried off my pictures.
I would suggest, captain, that he be properly rewarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, sorr.&rdquo; Phelan&rsquo;s voice shook with
gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that he gets full credit in my report,&rdquo;
said Captain Stone stiffly. &ldquo;Now, Phelan, you go to
the station for the patrol wagon. I sent it back, as
one of the horses threw a shoe and got a bad fall.
Tell the driver to get another horse at Murphy&rsquo;s
stable and hurry back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sorr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan went out, walking on air and humming to
himself, &ldquo;Sergt. Michael Phelan, no less,&rdquo; utterly
forgetful of the sorry plight he was in not a half
hour before.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin was almost beside himself with
chagrin. Again he made an impassioned plea to be
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see here, Captain, <i>I</i> am Travers Gladwin&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are, eh?&rdquo; sneered the captain, scarcely
deigning to look at him. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see about
that. Where is the little Jap who notified me of
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato had concealed himself behind a heavy piece
of furniture and was yanked out into the open by a
burly policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you,&rdquo; growled the captain, shaking his
hand at the Jap, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re Mr. Gladwin&rsquo;s servant, you
said&ndash;&ndash;which one of these men is your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato locked his teeth together and refused
even to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is your master? Answer me!&rdquo; demanded
Captain Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor little devil is frightened to death,&rdquo; interposed
the thief with a commiserating nod toward
the Jap. He was playing his bluff to the limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What scared him like that?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this gang here&ndash;&ndash;some of the others got away&ndash;&ndash;threatened
to kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, Captain&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; broke in Gladwin,
making furious, yet vain, gestures at Bateato.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; Captain Stone cut him off again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admire this chap&rsquo;s nerve, Captain,&rdquo; laughed
the thief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s monumental. He very nearly succeeded
in bluffing Officer Phelan, but I guess you can
take care of him all right&ndash;&ndash;I must hurry off and get
an expert to repair the damage done to these valuable
paintings. Of course, you&rsquo;ll leave a man or two on
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>Once more he gathered up his stick and overcoat
and once more his exit was blocked&ndash;&ndash;this time by
Whitney Barnes.</p>
<p>It was only natural for that young man to misread
the situation and conceive that Mrs. Elvira Burton
had succeeded in her object of arresting his friend.
So he blurted breathlessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, Travers, I see I&rsquo;m too late. I&rsquo;ve been
all over the city trying to warn you&ndash;&ndash;I knew the
police were on your track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the devil are you?&rdquo; Captain Stone cut in
on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another of the gang,&rdquo; responded the thief
promptly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got some story trumped up that he
thinks will get him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll let him tell it then, and you&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;indicating
the thief&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;had better wait and hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something in the thief&rsquo;s manner that
had fired a spark of suspicion in the officer&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word about the girl,&rdquo; Travers managed
to whisper to Barnes in the moment Captain Stone
had turned to address the thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Barnes was replying when the Captain
flung round on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that whispering, and come over here where
I can get a good look at you. Which one of these
men is the real Gladwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, of course!&rdquo; Barnes nodded toward his
friend. The truth of the situation had at last
dawned upon him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>The thief smiled at Captain Stone and shook his
head as if in compliment of the nerve of some
criminals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the captain, turning to Barnes again.
&ldquo;And when did you find out that there was some
one else who claimed to be Travers Gladwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Barnes briskly, &ldquo;when Gladwin
and I were here together this afternoon. The doorbell
rang and two&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>His friend shook a vigorous warning. Barnes
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and two what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, the doorbell rang&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you said that!&rdquo; snapped Captain Stone.
&ldquo;The doorbell rang and two&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and two minutes after that it rang again&ndash;&ndash;rang
in an extraordinary kind of way, you know, as
if whoever was ringing it&ndash;&ndash;was ringing it because&ndash;&ndash;because
they wanted to come in&ndash;&ndash;come in in a hurry,
you see. Well, I went to the door&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did <i>you</i> go to the door?&rdquo; demanded Captain
Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, the bell rang&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go back to that again! Why did you go
to the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t at this minute remember exactly,
but I&rsquo;m under the impression I went to&ndash;&ndash;to find out
who was ringing the bell, just like that, as it were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough of you,&rdquo; snorted Captain Stone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
&ldquo;Ryan (to one of his men) take this one and slip
the nippers on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Captain, I can explain this.&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Travers
Gladwin essayed again, as he saw his friend struggling
in the grip of a blue-coated giant and spluttering
his protests against being handcuffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t explain anything to me,&rdquo; was the best
he got from Captain Stone.</p>
<p>During this spirited dialogue the thief had gone
to the side of Helen Burton, who had remained motionless
where she had risen from her chair, playing
the part of a helpless victim in the seemingly hopeless
tangle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Helen,&rdquo; he said to her in his old tone
of endearment, &ldquo;we can go. You see where this
impostor stands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you&ndash;&ndash;no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the uncompromising emphasis
of her denial.</p>
<p>Captain Stone set out to distribute his prisoners,
motioning to one policeman to take care of Gladwin
and to another to look after the Jap, who would be
needed as a witness.</p>
<p>He came last to Helen just as she had repulsed
the man she was to have eloped with that night.
Captain Stone had had experience enough with
women to be able to distinguish between types. He
was on the point of ordering another of his men to
take charge of Helen when he paused and studied her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
more closely. His men were starting for the door
with their prisoners when he signalled them to stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish to question this lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Helen, when there came swiftly into
the room Lieutenant Detective Kearney of the
Central Office.</p>
<p>Kearney was every inch a Central Office man, and
had been long enough at Headquarters to lose the
heavy bovine set of the man who pounds the pavement.
A strapping big fellow, with graying hair and
a pair of round bullet eyes that searched you with
needle points, his very appearance was sufficient corroboration
of all the thrilling stories the newspapers
printed of his skill and courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Kearney! What do you want?&rdquo; Captain
Stone addressed him as he stopped in the doorway
and surveyed the remarkable scene before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Travers Gladwin,&rdquo; replied the
detective shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Travers Gladwin,&rdquo; spoke up the thief, easily,
but holding his head so that Kearney could see only
the profile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name!&rdquo; exclaimed Travers Gladwin
in the same breath with the impostor.</p>
<p>Kearney looked from one to the other, fairly pistolling
his scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, both of you named Travers Gladwin?&rdquo; he
asked with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one&rsquo;s a fake,&rdquo; interposed Captain Stone,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
pointing to the real Gladwin. &ldquo;This&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;nodding toward
the impostor&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;is the real Travers Gladwin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kearney&rsquo;s face showed no more expression than if
it had been cut for a cameo, but when the thief asked
him with perfect self-command: &ldquo;What can I do for
you?&rdquo; he came on into the room and stopped directly
in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a warrant for your arrest,&rdquo; he said,
abruptly, and stuck his hand in his pocket for the
document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My arrest! For what?&rdquo; said the thief with a
beautifully feigned amazement and a little laugh of
incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cradle snatching&ndash;&ndash;abduction,&rdquo; jerked out Kearney,
unfolding the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is rich!&rdquo; laughed the thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the warrant from&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Kearney stopped and
his little bullet eyes went to work on the thief from
the ground up. He was measuring every inch of the
man with an eye that had been trained for years
to keep tabs on a multitude of marked and measured
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind coming over here&ndash;&ndash;a step or
two closer, Mr.&ndash;&ndash;Gladwin?&rdquo; he said tensely.</p>
<p>The thief stepped toward him and directly under
the electrolier, while the others in the room stood like
statues, looking on.</p>
<p>As Kearney continued his searching examination of
the unflinching and still smiling man, whose head was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
on a level with his and whose body was every inch
as big and well set up, Captain Stone broke in nervously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Kearney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s some mistake, sir,&rdquo; said the detective,
grimly. &ldquo;Are you sure this man is Travers
Gladwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be in some doubt about it,&rdquo; said
the thief, dropping his thumbs in the pockets of his
waistcoat and raising his chin a little. Whatever was
going on inside him, his eyes were twinkling with
amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Kearney retorted; then to Captain Stone,
&ldquo;What is this case Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picture robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Picture robbery! I was sure of it! You&rsquo;ve made
a mistake, Captain. I know this man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentences came out like a succession of pistol
shots, while his eyes never left the face of the thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; he attacked the smile again. It
was a bullet-proof smile and never wavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who is he?&rdquo; interrupted the real Travers
Gladwin, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the greatest picture <i>expert</i> in&ndash;&ndash;the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You flatter me,&rdquo; said the thief with a bow, and
a side glance at Helen Burton, who was gazing at
him as if both fascinated and repelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit it then,&rdquo; said Kearney roughly, unable
to disguise the triumph he felt at this identification
of a man he had never seen before.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so egotistical,&rdquo; the other bowed, &ldquo;but I
will go along with you with pleasure and see what
you are able to prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this, Kearney?&rdquo; asked Captain
Stone, still doubting and hating to admit he had
been led into an egregious blunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; retorted the detective. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
fooling them on the other side for several years, but
they nearly got him in Scotland Yard two months
ago. I got a full report on him from his straight
eyebrows and gray eyes down to the cut of his vest,
with picture and measurement attached. His real
name is Alf Wilson&ndash;&ndash;there were a hundred men on
his trail, but he made a getaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there&rsquo;s any use trying to deny
all this now,&rdquo; said Wilson, without the slightest
change of tone, shoving his hands into his trousers
pockets and lifting his head in contemplation of the
pictures on the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest,&rdquo; returned the detective, snatching
a pair of handcuffs from his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait just a moment, officer,&rdquo; interrupted Travers
Gladwin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask this man one question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted,&rdquo; cried the picture expert, turning and
showing all his teeth in a mocking smile.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin pointed to the portrait of &ldquo;The
Blue Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know I bought that picture in London
upon certain misrepresentations?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I was the man behind the gun&ndash;&ndash;think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung round to face the spurious Gainsborough.
As he did so something caught his eye and
he moved toward the portrait. Gladwin followed
and inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you not only knew it was a fake, but when
I bought it and what I paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew about it,&rdquo; came the jaunty reply, &ldquo;because
<i>I</i> painted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved another step nearer the painting as
Gladwin gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on lightly, running his hand along
the bottom of the frame, &ldquo;according to this gentleman,&rdquo;
and he nodded over his shoulder to Kearney,
who had kept pace with him, backing to cover the
doorway, &ldquo;your &lsquo;Blue Boy&rsquo; was painted by the greatest
picture expert in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the last word came laughingly from his lips the
room was plunged in darkness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<h3>REPARTEE AND A REVOLVER MUZZLE.</h3>
</div>
<p>The inky blackness fell upon the room with palpable
suddenness&ndash;&ndash;like a blinding flash, numbing for a
moment the senses of all who had been taken by
surprise. The reflex of the shock was manifested in
a very babel of incoherent shouts, jostlings and stumblings
and sharp collisions with the furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn up the lights,&rdquo; shouted Captain Stone, amid
the tumult.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin made a blind dive toward the
wall and stumbled headlong over the great antique
chest which stood to one side of where he and the
thief had stood contemplating &ldquo;The Blue Boy.&rdquo; In
stumbling against the chest he felt something that
was a revelation to him by the time he found the
switch button and brought back a flood of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, men, cover the doors&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t let any one
get out,&rdquo; yelled Captain Stone, pivoting on his heel
as his eyes vainly sought the picture expert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; cried Kearney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, up the stairs&ndash;&ndash;I hear him,&rdquo; yelled Gladwin.
&ldquo;There are two back stairways and the roof. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
are two basement exits&ndash;&ndash;post your men out there,
and down through that hallway on the left&ndash;&ndash;the
panel door&ndash;&ndash;that leads to the kitchen. Barnes, you
and Bateato take the young lady up to my study&ndash;&ndash;quick!&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll
look after this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most remarkable thing about it was that every
command the young man shouted was obeyed. Even
Kearney was fooled and rushed headlong up the
stairs, followed by two policemen and Barnes, who
was yelling: &ldquo;Hey! come back here and unlock me!
How can I hunt that chap with these handcuffs on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might as well have appealed to the moon.</p>
<p>Bateato fairly dragged Helen up the stairs after
him and guided her to the magnificently furnished
study and den to the right of the staircase, when he
switched on the lights and became furiously active
in the interest of the young girl&rsquo;s comfort.</p>
<p>Captain Stone had rushed out into the street and
posted men on the stoop and at the basement exits;
then, followed by the last lone patrolman of his
squad, he darted through the alley at the side of the
mansion which led to the rear yard.</p>
<p>The emptying of the room was accomplished
in a few seconds, whereupon Gladwin hastened
to the doorway, reached for the folding doors
and hauled them to, fastening the latch. Next
he shut the door to the kitchen hallway and
fastened that, when, with a sigh of relief, he walked
to the long carved oak table that flanked the window,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
hoisted himself on it, produced his gold cigarette
case, took out a cigarette, set fire to it, snapped
the case and returned it to his pocket.</p>
<p>While he inhaled a deep breath of stimulating
smoke his eyes were fixed upon the great chest directly
in front of him.</p>
<p>He was sitting easily on the table, kicking his legs,
and he continued just in that attitude when the lid
of the chest lifted a few inches and a small brilliantly
nickelled revolver came out and covered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m waiting for yez, Misther Gladwin,&rdquo; chuckled
the young man.</p>
<p>By some strange psychologic freak he was not in
the least dismayed by the ominous menace of that
shining muzzle, which gradually came further out as
the arm and head of the picture expert followed it.</p>
<p>Once the thief had glimpsed the young man and
made out that they had the room to themselves he
came out of the chest as lightly and noiselessly as he
had enveloped himself in it. But his smile was gone
now and in its place there was the wariness of the
hunted animal. Still covering Gladwin and surveying
the room he said in low, level tones:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you move it&rsquo;ll be the last act of your life,
McGinty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murphy, sorr,&rdquo; purred Gladwin, his face abeam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like your nerve, young un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taking lessons from the man who invented
nerve.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t seem anxious to give the alarm,&rdquo;
said Wilson, toying with the little automatic and
turning it over in the expanse of his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid it might make you nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might make me so nervous that this gun would
go off, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow of the old smile came back as he went
stealthily to the door and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to enjoy smoking,&rdquo; said the peer of art
collectors, turning his back to Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you time to smoke a cigar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a good one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s the one you gave me while I
was Officer 666.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin tossed the cigar to the thief, who caught
it deftly and inserted it between his lips. &ldquo;And
here&rsquo;s some more of your possessions,&rdquo; added the
young man, drawing out the bribe money he had accepted
while he masqueraded in the officer&rsquo;s uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Wilson, as he caught the money,
&ldquo;and here&rsquo;s your little yellow boy, though I wish
that intellectual giant of a cop were here so I could
hire his uniform for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You amaze me by your generosity,&rdquo; murmured
Gladwin as he pocketed the $500 bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the other easily, while he again listened
at the door. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a regular crook&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m in the
picture business.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Still, if you kept that bill it might help you get
better accommodations when you reach Sing Sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t need it till then I won&rsquo;t need it for a
long, long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you think you&rsquo;re going to escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin slid down from the table and leaned
against it, making no effort to conceal the admiration
he experienced for this man&rsquo;s superhuman
aplomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with guards all around the house and policemen
tearing thirty rooms apart upstairs and camping
on the roof scuttle&ndash;&ndash;yes, and more coming, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I venture to hope so,&rdquo; chuckled the other. &ldquo;I admit
it&rsquo;s close enough to be interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll say one thing for you,&rdquo; the young
millionaire said earnestly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the coolest chap I
ever hope to meet. You&rsquo;re a marvel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Built to order to work in story books, eh? Well,
to be candid with you, McGinty, there are times when
I&rsquo;m not so cool as I look. I&rsquo;m almost human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those cops will finish their work soon&ndash;&ndash;then
they&rsquo;ll come in here,&rdquo; Gladwin warned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening for them,&rdquo; said Wilson softly, putting
his ear to the door again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because your pistol prevents me from calling
them now, don&rsquo;t think&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gun isn&rsquo;t stopping you,&rdquo; came the short reply.
&ldquo;If you wanted to call them you&rsquo;d take a chance&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve
found that out in the last hundred seconds
or so.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for the compliment, but I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll prove it,&rdquo; the thief intervened, and
tossed the gun to Gladwin, who caught it as if it
were something hot. &ldquo;Go ahead and call them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I wouldn&rsquo;t call them?&rdquo; the
young man asked, examining the automatic and finding
it empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a child,&rdquo; shrugged the other. &ldquo;You
closed these doors, and you butted in about the &lsquo;Blue
Boy&rsquo; just as that Central Office owl produced his
jewelry. Yes, and you stumbled against the chest
and knew that I was in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I say,&rdquo; asked Gladwin, abruptly. &ldquo;How did
you come to use my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t safe to use mine, and when I met Miss&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;that
girl&ndash;&ndash;your name was in my mind&ndash;&ndash;I borrowed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing I can&rsquo;t forgive you for,&rdquo; said
Gladwin, regretfully&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;to deceive her as you did.
That was rotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for your opinion on that,&rdquo; said the
picture expert, warmly. &ldquo;How can a man like you
understand a man like me? It can&rsquo;t be done. We&rsquo;re
further apart than the poles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must see, Wilson&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s the name, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do for the nonce, kind sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must see that the game is up. If you
take my advice you won&rsquo;t even try to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t take your advice,&rdquo; said Wilson,
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all these policemen know you&rsquo;re a big prize.
If they find you and you break for it, they&rsquo;ll shoot&ndash;&ndash;and
shoot to kill if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thief flung round on him and his face was
suddenly drawn and serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death, my dear Gladwin, is the very least of my
troubles, if it will only come like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! I like you&ndash;&ndash;and I hope you escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you do,&rdquo; said Wilson, shaking his head,
&ldquo;but not altogether on my account. You&rsquo;re thinking
of her&ndash;&ndash;the girl. You don&rsquo;t want it to be known
that she was going to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be frank, yes. They&rsquo;re coming now. Quick!
Do something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thief seized from the floor one of the porti&egrave;res
he had torn down to wrap the canvases in, wound it
about him and darted behind the curtains that
screened the window. As he vanished Gladwin went
to the door and heard the voice of his friend, Whitney
Barnes, demanding admission.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<h3>HANDCUFFS AND LOVE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Helen Burton could not have found a cozier
place to faint in than that ultra-luxurious den of
Travers Gladwin. Every chair and divan in the place
invited one to swoon within its folds.</p>
<p>The young man had ordered his decorator to provide
him with a chamber wherein stiffness and formality
would be impossible unless one stood erect.
The decorator had spent money with a lavish hand
upon Spanish leathers and silken stuffs from the near
East and the Orient and he had laid these trappings
over the softest of swan&rsquo;s down. Once you sank upon
them you could not help a sensation of utter peace
and relaxation.</p>
<p>That final and irrevocable blasting of her ideal was
a shock upon many shocks that the young girl had experienced
within the course of a few hours and that
she reached the den on her feet was due more to Bateato&rsquo;s
strength and agility than to any nervous or
physical force within her slender body.</p>
<p>The little Jap had fairly flown up the stairs with
her in such fashion that she had no distinct recollection
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
of her feet touching any stable surface. Then he
had turned a sharp corner while she seemed to stream
behind him like a fluttering pennant, and next she had
felt herself sink into a soft, delicious embrace, when
her senses left her and she seemed to drop pleasantly
through fathomless space.</p>
<p>It was a great crimson chair embroidered with yellow
poppies into which Bateato had dropped his burden,
then switched on a myriad of tiny lamps suspended
from the ceiling by slim chains of different
lengths or gleaming from dark niches and embrasures
in the tapestry-hung walls.</p>
<p>All these subdued and colored lights mingled to
produce a wonderfully soft and reposeful effect, and
when at last Helen opened her eyes&ndash;&ndash;and her swoon
had been of only a few minutes&rsquo; duration&ndash;&ndash;she was
sure that the setting was a dream and half expected
some impossible creature of phantasmagoria to rise
from the floor and address her.</p>
<p>Then she felt an intermittent draught upon her
cheek and looked up to see Whitney Barnes fanning
her with an elaborate contrivance of peacock feathers
that was alleged to have once done duty in the harem
of Abdul Hamid, one-time Sultan of Turkey.</p>
<p>She was not sure at first that this strange looking
being who fanned her in such an amazing fashion was
the young friend of the real Travers Gladwin who
had appeared on the scene from time to time during
that fateful afternoon, for his features were far from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
being in repose. Positive torture was written on his
clean-cut boyish face as he wielded that fast fan in
his handcuffed hands as if it were a task imposed
upon him by some evil spirit.</p>
<p>Certainly there was no grace in the savage gestures
of his arms as his wrists twisted and writhed in their
shackles, but he stuck to his task desperately, now
and then hissing over his shoulder at Bateato to learn
why in thunder he didn&rsquo;t find smelling salts or whiskey
or brandy or something with which to restore the
young lady to consciousness.</p>
<p>And on his part, Bateato was racing about like a
scared mouse, diving into mysterious chests and cabinets
or under divans or climbing up the walls to explore
recessed shelves. His activities were confined to
that one chamber, for a big, implacable policeman
stood at the entrance, with orders to keep his eye on
the young woman and the Jap and see that they did
not escape or attempt to assist the vanished picture
expert in concealing himself or getting away.</p>
<p>As Helen&rsquo;s dazed faculties gradually resumed their
normal activities and she realized that Whitney
Barnes was a reality, the humor of the situation suddenly
struck her fancy and she smiled. She was smiling
with eyes and lips when young Barnes turned back
his head from another reproach of Bateato and
looked to see how she was coming on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I thought you
were dead. I wanted to go out for a doctor, but these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
confounded policemen wouldn&rsquo;t let me&ndash;&ndash;yes, and they
wouldn&rsquo;t unlock me. Have I fanned enough? I&rsquo;m
pretty well tuckered out, and these feathers get in
one&rsquo;s nose so. Then this is an extraordinary kind of
a fan&ndash;&ndash;they use them in harems or something of the
sort, and I&rsquo;ve never fanned in harems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please stop, then,&rdquo; laughed Helen, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m a
thousand times obliged to you. If I could only have
a glass of water I think I would be myself again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato had at last pried into a cabinet that contained
a decanter of brandy and strange looking
Moorish goblets, and from some curtained enclosure
he obtained cold water from a faucet. A sip of the
potent brandy and draught of water brought the
color back to the girl&rsquo;s cheeks and the light to her
eyes. The change was so reassuring that Whitney
Barnes actually beamed and for a few moments
dropped all thought of his handcuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, but you are beautiful!&rdquo; he said impulsively.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame Travers for going daffy in the Ritz,
and do you know your eyes are exactly like your
cousin&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen laughed in spite of herself at the young
man&rsquo;s headlong gush of words, then became suddenly
serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t time to talk about eyes now,&rdquo; she said
soberly. &ldquo;You must assist me in telling these policemen
how I brought this terrible embarrassment upon
Mr. Gladwin.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; retorted Barnes. &ldquo;He
wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. He&rsquo;d cut off both his arms
before he&rsquo;d allow your name to be dragged into such
a sensation. And I&rsquo;d add mine, too, willingly, with
these bracelets on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that detective said he had a warrant for Mr.
Gladwin for eloping with me,&rdquo; cried Helen, blushing
scarlet. &ldquo;And, you know&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you&rsquo;re going to weep or faint or
something else. Tell me about your cousin&ndash;&ndash;she&rsquo;s
not m-m-married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie married!&rdquo; ejaculated Helen. &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s
deathly afraid of men. She&rsquo;s the most timid little
thing in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Barnes, enthusiastically. &ldquo;These
handcuffs are not half bad, now you tell me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo; asked Helen, her
eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing,&rdquo; said Barnes, trying to look unconcerned.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s very young?&rdquo; he added quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year younger than I am,&rdquo; said Helen, mischievously.
There was something positively fascinating
about the intense seriousness that had fallen upon
the nervous features of Whitney Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not too young to marry?&rdquo; was his next
query.</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; Helen hesitated, &ldquo;though I suppose you&rsquo;d
have to ask Auntie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you didn&rsquo;t have to do that,&rdquo; he said in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
alarm. &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he added quickly,
&ldquo;please forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are forgiven,&rdquo; said Helen, with a catch in
her breath; then resolutely, &ldquo;but that is all over with.
It wasn&rsquo;t really real&ndash;&ndash;only a bad dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t real,&rdquo; sympathized Barnes.
&ldquo;That fellow just hypnotized you&ndash;&ndash;and my eye, but
he&rsquo;s a wonderful looking chap&ndash;&ndash;sort of a Hercules
and Adonis all thrown into one. But to get back to
Sadie&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;m going to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are!&rdquo; Helen half started from her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be calm; be calm,&rdquo; and he waved her down with
his shackled hands. &ldquo;When I say I&rsquo;m going to marry
her I merely state a fond belief I have been cherishing
since, m&rsquo;m&ndash;&ndash;well since a very long time ago
to-day or yesterday, for to-day is to-morrow by this
time, you know. Now don&rsquo;t stop me&ndash;&ndash;I say I am
going to marry your cousin because I believe in Destiny
with a big D. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Helen grimly, &ldquo;but now I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; Barnes breezed on. &ldquo;You may
not think that you believe you do, but you really do,
and I wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if the destiny you
thought out&ndash;&ndash;as far as the name goes&ndash;&ndash;Travers Gladwin,
I mean&ndash;&ndash;comes true after all. But to come
back to Sadie and my Destiny. I have really got to
marry her&ndash;&ndash;orders from headquarters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders from headquarters!&rdquo; gasped Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! My governor&ndash;&ndash;that is, my dad&ndash;&ndash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
is, the pater&ndash;&ndash;wrung a promise from me, issued a
command, a ukase, an ultimatum&ndash;&ndash;said: &lsquo;Whitney
Barnes, you go right out and get married and bring
home a lot of grand-children.&rsquo; No; that wasn&rsquo;t it
exactly&ndash;&ndash;now let me think a moment. Yes, I&rsquo;ve got
it&ndash;&ndash;he said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve simply got to marry and settle
down or I&rsquo;ll turn you out into the street.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that enough to take the wind out of you,
when you&rsquo;d never given the idea of marriage a
thought. Simply bowled me over. At first I refused
point blank, but when I saw how cut up the poor old
dad was about it I shook his hand and said: &lsquo;Pater,
done&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll go right out and find a wife.&rsquo; And I
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Helen faintly. &ldquo;You went right out
and got married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, my dear cousin. I simply found
Sadie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you asked her? Not surely while we
were here this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I saw her later&ndash;&ndash;when she came to-night with
your aunt, while your aunt was searching all over
the place for you. Not that I really asked her then,
but we looked at each other, you know, and I think
we liked each other&ndash;&ndash;and that&rsquo;s a big start. I just
know we&rsquo;ll get married&ndash;&ndash;we&rsquo;re soul-mates! There
isn&rsquo;t any doubt of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it strikes me,&rdquo; said Helen severely, &ldquo;that
you&rsquo;re a trifle conceited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am,&rdquo; was his startling response.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be, in love. If you don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re
pretty fine how are you going to convince anybody
else that you are? But you&rsquo;ll have to excuse me for
a moment&ndash;&ndash;these bracelets are cutting my wrists to
pieces. I must find that man who locked me up. You
must stay here till I come back&ndash;&ndash;I won&rsquo;t be a minute,&rdquo;
and the young man darted out of the room with a
ludicrous diving motion of his arms as he parted the
heavy crimson silk hangings at the doorway and
caromed against the big policeman on guard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<h3>KEARNEY MEETS HIS MATCH.</h3>
</div>
<p>There was no turning Whitney Barnes away with
a soft answer. His appeals for admission were rising
to a strident pitch when his friend opened the door
and yanked him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo; demanded Barnes, looking
about wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Gladwin returned. &ldquo;I think he escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean the robber Johnny,&rdquo; complained
Barnes, shaking out his handcuffed wrists. &ldquo;I mean
the damned idiot who locked these things on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s searching the house,&rdquo; said Gladwin, smiling
at his friend&rsquo;s tragic earnestness.</p>
<p>Detective Kearney came into the room alert as a
race horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through the house from cellar to
roof,&rdquo; he spat out while his eyes searched every corner
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say&ndash;&ndash;look here,&rdquo; said Barnes, &ldquo;can you unlock
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Kearney would not even look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it, somebody ought to unlock me!&rdquo; exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
the frantic Barnes. &ldquo;This is the most annoying
position I was ever in in my life. My valet
even couldn&rsquo;t undress me with these things on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s out that way?&rdquo; asked Kearney, pointing
to the panel door that opened upon the backstairs
hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitchen,&rdquo; said Gladwin, going to the door and
opening it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Kearney, &ldquo;the captain&rsquo;s back
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look here, detective,&rdquo; cried Barnes again,
&ldquo;who was that inordinate ass who locked me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ryan!&rdquo; said Kearney, freezing a smile as it
formed on his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce is he doing on the roof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Searching it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; stormed Barnes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up there and if
he don&rsquo;t unlock me I&rsquo;ll push him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dashed out of the room and up the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny thing where that man got to, Mr. Gladwin,&rdquo;
mused the Central Office man, with a keen
glance from under his heavy eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those chaps are clever, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; returned
the young man with affected unconcern. &ldquo;I suppose
he&rsquo;s miles away by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gone very far,&rdquo; rejoined Kearney,
his voice bristling with suspicion. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
have got away without the men outside seeing him.
We&rsquo;ve got the block surrounded now. He&rsquo;s here in
this house, Mr. Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;I guess you know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything of the kind,&rdquo; Gladwin
denied, with a trifle too much emphasis. A policeman
appeared in the doorway and Kearney called to him,
&ldquo;Ryan, I thought you were on the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeant Burke sent me down,&rdquo; responded Ryan.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got the roofs covered both way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the man you put the bracelets on?&rdquo;
asked Kearney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Ryan, &ldquo;but I heard a lot of noise
going up one of the back stairways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better go and find him,&rdquo; urged Travers Gladwin.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in an awful state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; countermanded Kearney, &ldquo;never mind him
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re wasting time here,&rdquo; persisted Gladwin.
&ldquo;I can look after this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh, no, you can&rsquo;t!</i>&rdquo; Kearney flashed back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;re under arrest. I was after you
when I happened to find the other fellow. I haven&rsquo;t
any idea you&rsquo;ll try and escape, Mr. Gladwin, but a
warrant is a warrant and duty&rsquo;s duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that warrant wasn&rsquo;t meant for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kearney&rsquo;s eyes widened with surprise. &ldquo;Was the
girl running off with that crook?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Gladwin corrected, realizing his break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you better go along with Ryan. Ryan, you
take him upstairs and sit by him till I send for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; the young man began to splutter as
the giant Ryan seized him and walked him on air out
of the room and up the stairs.</p>
<p>Kearney went to the folding doors and shut them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in this room somewhere,&rdquo; muttered the detective,
going to the porti&egrave;res that curtained the window
leading out to the balcony.</p>
<p>He was almost touching Wilson when the latter
suddenly enveloped him in the porti&egrave;re he had
wrapped around himself and hurled the big detective
to the floor. As Kearney was untangling himself
Wilson darted between the porti&egrave;res, glanced out the
window and saw that a leap from the balcony would
land him in the arms of three patrolmen. He shook
open the window and then shrank back into the far
corner of the embrasure.</p>
<p>Kearney was on his feet again and sprang out to
the balcony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came out this way,&rdquo; he yelled to the men
below. &ldquo;Did he jump off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kearney darted back into the room, looked everywhere,
ran to the folding doors and flung them open.
Then he looked back at the panel door, noticed that
it was ajar and dived for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hiding somewhere in this black alley,&rdquo; he
said with an oath, and disappeared.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>A moment later Wilson peeked out and re-entered
the room. He had scarcely left his place of concealment
when Officer No. 666 burst in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there ye are, Mr. Gladwin!&rdquo; said Phelan,
with a lovely grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m here,&rdquo; nodded Wilson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just come back with another bunch of cops,&rdquo;
said Phelan, &ldquo;but I hear the crook got away. He&rsquo;s
a smooth snake fer ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I think he&rsquo;s still in the house,&rdquo; laughed Wilson,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like to have you get the credit of catching
him, Phelan. You go outside and report to the
captain, then come back here. Maybe I can help you
find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, sorr,&rdquo; said Phelan, obeying the suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes another one,&rdquo; breathed the thief,
hearing a heavy tread and crossing the room to the
big ornamental fireplace which had never known a
spark or speck of soot. There was a mammoth opening
in the chimney and Wilson vanished up it as
Kearney plunged back into the room.</p>
<p>As the detective entered through the panel door,
Watkins in full chauffeur regalia appeared from the
hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, who sent you?&rdquo; Kearney pounced on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Watkins returned. &ldquo;Some man&ndash;&ndash;Gladwin,
I think, is the name. I was sent here for
a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you sit out in the hall and wait,&rdquo; snapped
Kearney, who again proceeded to explore the room,
muttering and cursing.</p>
<p>The voice of Travers Gladwin in heated argument
upstairs with Officer Ryan became audible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle that fresh kid!&rdquo; Kearney ejaculated,
and made a break for the stairs.</p>
<p>His departure was Wilson&rsquo;s cue to let himself
down from the chimney. He signalled Watkins, who
was sitting in the hall. Watkins glided in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; exclaimed Wilson, &ldquo;we are going it
some in here. You certainly are taking big chances
butting in. I didn&rsquo;t think you had the nerve. It&rsquo;s
a hundred to one against me, but I&rsquo;ve beaten bigger
odds than that. You get up that chimney and I&rsquo;ll
plant myself in the chest. Quick, they&rsquo;re coming
down again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watkins went up the chimney with the sinuous
speed of a snake, and the picture expert went into
the chest with the agility of a wolf spider ducking
into its trap.</p>
<p>They were coming from all directions this time&ndash;&ndash;Gladwin
down the stairs, about fourteen jumps
ahead of Kearney, proclaiming that he would telephone
his lawyer and that he could put up $5,000,000
in bonds for bail if need be. Phelan was coming
through the front door and Captain Stone through
the hallway from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Glimpsing Gladwin, Phelan made a flying dive for
him, yelling, &ldquo;I got him! I got him!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>They rolled on the floor in a heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got him, Phelan?&rdquo; cried Captain Stone,
rushing through the room and into the hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, sorr,&rdquo; responded Phelan, proudly, getting
to his feet and pulling up his captive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s this,&rdquo; bawled Captain Stone,
recognizing Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thief, sorr,&rdquo; responded Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thief, hell! That&rsquo;s Mr. Gladwin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-w-w-what?&rdquo; stuttered Phelan. Once again he
entered into a condition of complete mental paralysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he hurt you, sir?&rdquo; asked the captain, solicitously,
noticing that Gladwin&rsquo;s face was writhing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing mortal,&rdquo; winced the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Phelan,&rdquo; the captain
jumped on him. &ldquo;Have you been drunk to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sorr,&rdquo; gurgled Phelan, &ldquo;I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to stop me, officer, I&rsquo;ve come for my
niece,&rdquo; crashed the shrill voice of Mrs. Elvira Burton.
She had seized a dramatic moment for her re-entry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<h3>PILING ON PHELAN&rsquo;S AGONY.</h3>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton would have arrived much earlier
into the midst of the maelstrom of events at the Gladwin
mansion had not Fate in the shape of a tire-blowout
intervened.</p>
<p>She had set out from Police Headquarters with
Detective Kearney as a passenger and she had urged
her red-headed chauffeur to pay not the slightest heed
to speed laws or any other laws. He had obeyed
with such enthusiasm that the blowout had occurred
at the intersection of Fifth avenue and Forty-second
street.</p>
<p>Late as the hour was there was a large crowd gathered
to hear the society leader of Omaha deliver a
lecture in strange French and caustic English.</p>
<p>Kearney had transshipped to a taxicab, which accounted
for his earlier arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in charge here?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Burton, sweeping
into the room with all sails set and drawing to
the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Captain Stone, none too pleasantly
as the gold lorgnettes were waved under his nose.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I came for my niece&ndash;&ndash;produce her at once,&rdquo;
insisted the panting woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wait a few minutes,&rdquo; answered
Captain Stone, grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re otherwise engaged
at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have a warrant&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ve ordered Mr. Gladwin&rsquo;s
arrest!&rdquo; she shrilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll attend to that later,&rdquo; snapped the captain.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for a thief who broke in here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thief!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Burton. &ldquo;Well, I saw
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the amazed officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when I was here before, and there he is now,
only he&rsquo;s got a policeman&rsquo;s uniform on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton pointed an accusing finger at Michael
Phelan, who proceeded to turn livid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw that man here before?&rdquo; asked the wondering
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He was in his shirt sleeves and when he
saw me he ran away to hide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure about this?&rdquo; asked Captain Stone
slowly, turning and scowling at the condemned
Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say I am,&rdquo; declared the relentless Mrs.
Burton. &ldquo;How could I ever forget that face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-c-c-captain, I-I-I w-w-want to explain&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;chattered
Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be time enough for that,&rdquo; the captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
checked him. &ldquo;For the present you camp right here
in this room. Don&rsquo;t you budge an inch from it. That
thief is somewhere in this house and we&rsquo;ve got to find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my niece first,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>Captain Stone ignored the request and shouted to
Kearney and the three men who had followed him
into the room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we are wasting time. This house must be
searched again and searched thoroughly. I don&rsquo;t believe
you have half done it. Lead the way, Kearney,
we&rsquo;ll begin on the next floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they went out Sadie Burton timidly approached
Whitney Barnes, who was still making the rounds of
every policeman in the house and pleading to be unlocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do&ndash;&ndash;what is the matter?&rdquo; she said
timidly, looking up into Barnes&rsquo;s distressed face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do at all,&rdquo; replied Barnes, tragically, folding
his arms in an effort to conceal the handcuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you seem to have a chill,&rdquo; Sadie sympathized,
with real concern in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say I have,&rdquo; gasped Barnes, &ldquo;a most
awful chill. But it may pass off. Excuse me, here&rsquo;s
a new policeman I haven&rsquo;t asked yet.&rdquo; The young
man crossed the room to Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a key to these infernal shackles?&rdquo;
he asked, while Sadie looked wonderingly after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a key to nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; growled Phelan.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;d like to kill some of yez.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>Barnes retreated, backing into Mrs. Burton, who
turned and seized him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where my niece is?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she&rsquo;s here, only you&rsquo;re breaking my
arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she and where is that fiend Gladwin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>the fiend Gladwin</i> just went upstairs to her.
She&rsquo;s upstairs asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&ndash;&ndash;go up and find her, that is&ndash;&ndash;I
beg your pardon&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll lead the way&ndash;&ndash;come, Miss
Sadie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The handcuffed youth led the procession up the
stairs, leaving Officer 666 as solitary sentinel in the
great drawing room and picture gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;m dished fer fair,&rdquo; groaned Phelan
as he mournfully surveyed the deserted room and
allowed his eyes to rest on the portrait of a woman
who looked out at him from mischievous blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; all fer a pair o&rsquo; them eyes,&rdquo; he added, wistfully.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis tough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He might have gone on at some length with this
doleful soliloquy had not a hand suddenly closed over
his mouth with the grip of a steel trap.</p>
<p>Alf Wilson had come out of the chest as noiselessly
as he had originally entered it and good fortune favored
him to the extent of placing Phelan with his
back to him while his troubled mind was steeped in
a mixture of love and despair.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>As the thief pounced upon the ill-fated Officer
666 he uttered, &ldquo;Pst! Pst! Watkins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That sinuous individual writhed out of the fireplace
and came to his assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get his elbows and put your knee in his back,&rdquo;
instructed the thief, &ldquo;while I reach for my ether-gun.
Thank God! Here it is in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan struggled in a fruitless effort to tear himself
free, but Wilson&rsquo;s grip was the grip of unyielding
withes of steel and the slim and wiry Watkins
was just as muscular for his weight.</p>
<p>It was the task of a moment for the picture expert
to bring round the little silver device he called his
ether-gun. Phelan was gasping for breath through
his nostrils, and Wilson had only to press the bulb
once or twice before the policeman&rsquo;s muscles relaxed
and he fell limply into Watkins&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll hold him for ten minutes at least,&rdquo;
breathed Wilson. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Watkins, prop him
up while I get his belt and coat off&ndash;&ndash;then into the
chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan was completely insensible, but his weight
and the squareness of his bulk made it a strenuous
task to support him and at the same time remove his
coat. Only a man of Wilson&rsquo;s size and prodigious
strength could have accomplished the feat in anything
like the time required, and both he and Watkins
were purple and breathless when they lowered
the again unfrocked Officer 666 into the chest and
piled porti&egrave;res and a small Persian rug on top of him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>While Watkins held up the lid the thief tore off
his claw-hammer coat and stuffed that down into the
chest. In another instant he had forced his shoulders
into the uniform coat, donned the cap and buckled
on the belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now break for it, Watkins,&rdquo; he gasped, fighting
the buttons into the buttonholes. &ldquo;Take it easy out
the front door. I&rsquo;ll go out on the balcony and call
down to the men in the street that it&rsquo;s all right.
Start the engine in the car and keep it going till I
can make my getaway. Now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watkins vanished out the door at the psychological
moment. Captain Stone and Kearney were coming
down the stairs engaged in earnest conversation. So
engrossed were they when they entered the room that
they failed to notice the absence of Officer 666, whose
uniform was strutting on the balcony while he himself
lay an&aelig;sthetized in the chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he have been hiding in those porti&egrave;res,
Kearney?&rdquo; Captain Stone was saying. &ldquo;I looked
through them before I left the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how, Captain,&rdquo; replied Kearney,
&ldquo;but he was and Gladwin knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, captain, do you know where Mr. Ryan
is?&rdquo; intervened the roving Barnes, who seemed to
have bobbed up from nowhere in particular with
Sadie in his train.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He may be in the cellar and he may be on the
roof,&rdquo; snapped the captain. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother me now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must bother you, by Jove,&rdquo; persisted the
frantic Barnes. &ldquo;I demand that you send that man
to unlock me. I&rsquo;m not a prisoner or that sort of
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Stone ignored him, addressing Kearney:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if he isn&rsquo;t out now&ndash;&ndash;he can&rsquo;t get out without
an airship. Still we had better search some more
below stairs. Where&rsquo;s that man Phelan gone? Look
out on the balcony, Kearney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kearney stepped to the curtains, pulled them back,
dropped them, and nodded, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, let&rsquo;s go down into the cellar and work
up. There isn&rsquo;t a room in the house now that isn&rsquo;t
guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dammit, Captain,&rdquo; exploded Barnes again,
rattling his handcuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t annoy me&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m busy,&rdquo; was
all the satisfaction he got as the captain and the Central
Office man left the room.</p>
<p>Sadie came forward shyly as the policemen left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find out where he is?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the cellar or on the roof. When I get to the
roof he is in the cellar, and when I reach the cellar
he is on the roof. He&rsquo;s more elusive than a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever are you talking about?&rdquo; cried Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ryan, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mean Mr. Ryan&ndash;&ndash;I mean the chauffeur
who came for Helen. I heard Mr. Kearney speaking
about him upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a chauffeur after her, too?&rdquo; said
Barnes, enigmatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and wasn&rsquo;t it fortunate that the police arrived
just in time to save her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; sniffed Barnes in disgust. &ldquo;A lot
they had to do with saving her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not. They bungled the whole thing
up horribly. Why they&rsquo;d have brought in a parson
to marry them if it hadn&rsquo;t been&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Barnes managed
to blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who did prevent the elopement?&rdquo; asked
Sadie, eagerly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get a word out of Helen
on account of Auntie El.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo; said Barnes, mysteriously, looking
down upon her with a sudden return of ardor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did you do it?&rdquo; and Sadie looked up at him
from under her lashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I&rsquo;d do it?&rdquo; swelled Barnes.</p>
<p>Sadie thanked him with her wonderfully expressive
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was nothing,&rdquo; shrugged Barnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the nicest man I ever met,&rdquo; blurted Sadie,
with astounding frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that?&rdquo; cried Barnes, rapturously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I mean it,&rdquo; admitted Sadie, timidly, backing
away from his burning glances.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t mind my saying,&rdquo; said Barnes
fervently, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re the nicest ma&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;I mean girl&ndash;&ndash;I
ever met. Why, would you believe it&ndash;&ndash;confound
it, here&rsquo;s that man Gladwin again. Please come upstairs
and I&rsquo;ll finish, handcuffs or no handcuffs.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
<h3>STRIKING WHILE THE IRON IS HOT.</h3>
</div>
<p>As Travers Gladwin skimmed up the stairs to warn
Helen of the arrival of her aunt, he was thinking on
four sides of his brain at the same time and
revolving together so many lightning plans, that the
result was a good deal of a jumble. In consequence,
he was wild-eyed, out of breath and more than a
trifle incoherent when he parted the crimson curtains
of the den and precipitately entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your aunt,&rdquo; he began as he checked his momentum
and stopped against a table beside which
Miss Burton was seated, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t get up&ndash;&ndash;and
don&rsquo;t be frightened. She need never know. I&rsquo;ll take
the blame for everything. I am the Travers Gladwin
you were going to elope with, and I&rsquo;ll go to jail if
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for breath, while Helen rose from her
chair and protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible, Mr. Gladwin. I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; the young man stopped her.
&ldquo;It is perfectly possible, and I only wish that I were
the man you had chosen to elope with. I&rsquo;d elope
with you now&ndash;&ndash;in a minute&ndash;&ndash;aunt or no aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You must not talk that way,&rdquo; cried the young girl,
her face aflame. &ldquo;You are only saying this out of
politeness, a sense of chivalry, and while I appreciate
all you are doing for me I could not accept any such
sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sacrifice!&rdquo; he retorted, with increasing ardor.
&ldquo;Call it blessing; call it heavenly boon; call it the
pinnacle of my desire, the apogee of my hopes&ndash;&ndash;call
it anything in the world but sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must not talk to me this way!&rdquo; exclaimed
the girl, sinking back into her chair and covering her
face with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I certainly must,&rdquo; the young man reeled on.
&ldquo;It is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth. It has come upon me like a stroke of lightning&ndash;&ndash;it
may not seem reasonable&ndash;&ndash;it may not seem
sane. I can&rsquo;t help that. It is here&ndash;&ndash;inside of
me&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; Helen interposed again, her voice faint
and tremulous. &ldquo;You are taking advantage of my
helpless situation. Why, you hardly know me!&rdquo; she
added, with a swift change of tone as if she had made
a sudden discovery. Taking her hands from her face
she looked up at him through widening eyes misty
with tears.</p>
<p>The young man bit his lip and turned his head
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said bitterly, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause. &ldquo;I had not thought of it in that light. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
does seem as if I were taking advantage of you.&rdquo;
He looked at her steadily a moment until she dropped
her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you think I am that sort of a man?&rdquo; he
asked abruptly and the tenseness of his voice made
her glance up at him again.</p>
<p>Helen made another remarkable discovery&ndash;&ndash;that
he had fine eyes and a splendid mouth and nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you think I am that sort of a man?&rdquo; he repeated
slowly, forcing her to continue to yield her
eyes to his earnest regard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Helen returned hastily. &ldquo;I did not
mean it that way&ndash;&ndash;only I cannot quite understand it.
You never saw me till a few hours ago, and then&ndash;&ndash;and
then I was engaged&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>She paused and shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was a case of hypnotism,&rdquo; burst out the
young man, letting himself go again. &ldquo;He is a marvelous
man. I wish I had half of his strength of
will and&ndash;&ndash;and good looks. It is past belief that he
is what he is, with all his talents, his appearance and
his magnificent courage. If it is in my power the
police shall not reach him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first my only object was to save you from the
dreadful position of becoming the wife of such a man,
and also from the scandal that must have followed
if your elopement were discovered and he were arrested.
But now I must confess that the man compels
my admiration, and that I want to see him free for
his own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And he is still in the house?&rdquo; said Helen, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, and here comes your aunt. Now, I pray
you, let me take the brunt of this storm. I will ask
nothing more of you. I am Travers Gladwin and
we were to have eloped&ndash;&ndash;do you promise? For here
she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Helen whispered, and then the storm burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here you are at last, Helen Burton,&rdquo; came the
first roll of thunder from the doorway.</p>
<p>It was not as terrifying a rumble as it might have
been had not the statuesque and tightly laced Mrs.
Burton lost a good deal of breath in coming up the
stairs. She came on into the room with tragic step,
followed by Whitney Barnes and Sadie, the latter
keeping very close to Barnes as if she feared that her
cousin would cover her with reproaches for having
revealed the secret of the projected elopement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, madam; calm yourself,&rdquo; began
Travers Gladwin, as he stepped between her and her
niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who are you, pray?&rdquo; asked the majestic
woman, haughtily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to blame for it all,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I am Travers
Gladwin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You are Travers Gladwin! You are the
wretch who sought to steal off in the dead of night
with my niece and ward. You! You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton looked unutterable threats and maledictions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
Travers Gladwin could not resist a smile,
which he hid by bowing low and stammering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must humbly confess to being myself and plead
guilty of the crime of falling passionately in love
with your niece. I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Helen rose quickly to her feet and confronted her
aunt. There was fire in the young girl&rsquo;s eye as she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Ella, it is all a mistake, this&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Helen,&rdquo; Gladwin turned and took the young
girl&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;please let me explain. You promised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She promised what?&rdquo; flared Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She foolishly promised to elope with me,&rdquo; said
Gladwin sweetly, &ldquo;but when she got here and thought
of the shock and grief that her dear aunt might suffer
she suddenly changed her mind. I had everything
arranged&ndash;&ndash;car waiting, parson waiting, marriage
license in my pocket, everything! You see madam,
I am the only guilty party. Your niece was the innocent
victim of my wiles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton looked from one to the other in complete
bewilderment. Helen could only blush and look
confused. The immensity of Gladwin&rsquo;s lie struck her
dumb. Sadie was staring at him in open-mouthed
amazement. Even Whitney Barnes blinked his eyes
and forgot his handcuffs.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin met Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s frowning and
perplexed stare with a fatuous smile. At last she
turned to Whitney Barnes and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he telling the truth?&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;HE&rsquo;S ALMOST AS MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER AS I AM.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Barnes, readily, &ldquo;and if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for me he might have kidnapped her. He&rsquo;s
almost as madly in love with her as I am&ndash;&ndash;you will
have to excuse me a moment, I think I see that man
Ryan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shackled young man suddenly darted out of
the room, followed by Sadie, who seemed irresistibly
drawn in his wake.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton looked after them helplessly. A suspicion
suddenly flashed in her brain and she turned
back to Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure that you are deceiving me,&rdquo; she charged
him, &ldquo;and that that other young man is Travers Gladwin.
You can&rsquo;t tell me that his wrists were not handcuffed,
for I just saw them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are entirely mistaken,&rdquo; Gladwin returned
soberly. &ldquo;If you will kindly step out into the music
room I will show you a modest portrait of myself that
was painted three years ago by an eminent American
artist. Helen you will pardon us for just a moment,&rdquo;
and he turned with a broad smile that won him a
smile in return, for the humor of the situation had
gradually beaten down whatever other emotions
stirred in the girl&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>Like one reluctantly led in a dream, Mrs. Burton
allowed Gladwin to escort her into the music room
outside and conduct her to a painting that hung in
an obscure corner of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it flatters me?&rdquo; he asked, as she
regarded it dumbly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>She looked at him curiously and then back at the
portrait, then shook her head and muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a mystery here somewhere. You are all
banded together in a conspiracy. I do not know whom
to believe. But it has gone far enough. We will go
back to Omaha to-morrow. I had no idea New York
was such a terrible place. Why are all these policemen
running about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mainly in your interest,&rdquo; responded Gladwin
quickly, &ldquo;but if you will consent not to send me to
jail I will get them out of the house and keep the
unhappy termination of my romance out of the newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it must not get in the newspapers,&rdquo;
cried the horrified Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, madam, if you will go back to Helen and
promise not to be too hard with her I will attend
to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was your father&rsquo;s name Edwin Gladwin?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Burton, looking at him with a swift change of
expression as he led her back to the room he called
his den.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;but if you will excuse
me I will endeavor to get rid of all these policemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly darted from her and descended the
stairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
<h3>THE ESCAPE.</h3>
</div>
<p>While he had not the slightest notion where the
picture expert had managed to conceal himself during
his own enforced absence from the scene of the chase,
Travers Gladwin was confident that the man was
capable of outwitting an army of the sort of man-hunters
who were swarming within and without the
aristocratic premises.</p>
<p>When he caught sight of Whitney Barnes and
Sadie in a tender confab that was just about to frond
out into the full foliage of a romantic climax, it
was on his tongue to bid them carry their hearts
upstairs and string them together in a more secluded
spot. They beat him to his own suggestion, and
were gone before he could utter a syllable.</p>
<p>He had the great drawing room and picture gallery
to himself and was scanning every corner of it
when a voice punctuated the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mr. Gladwin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man turned quickly and saw what he at
first mistook for a uniformed constable emerge from
the porti&egrave;res that screened the window.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it isn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he began in gaping surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murphy, sorr, only a tighter fit.&rdquo; Wilson stepped
through the curtains twirling his club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are 666 now, eh?&rdquo; Gladwin blurted. &ldquo;And
Phelan&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman who belongs in this tight-fitting
frock? Oh, he&rsquo;s still about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you managed to bribe him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly that, Mr. Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;say I persuaded
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hat is off to you again,&rdquo; exclaimed the young
man, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t waste any time. You can get away
easily in that uniform&ndash;&ndash;quick, and good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never hurry in these cases,&rdquo; returned the thief,
with an air of calm indifference. &ldquo;You see, I have
an idea that the Captain and Kearney are waiting for
me at the front door, for they made a loud declaration
that they were going to search the cellar. I
have had similar experiences, my young friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t leave the front door, and they may
burst in here at any moment,&rdquo; protested Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will leave the front door when I want
them to,&rdquo; said the other, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By jove, you&rsquo;re a wonderful chap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to be to keep out of jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame that you misdirect your energies and
genius,&rdquo; said the young man, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must acknowledge that I work hard for
what I get.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I really love pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, yes&ndash;&ndash;for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin stood frowning at the floor for a
moment, then looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, then&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve worked mighty hard for
my pictures and I&rsquo;m going to give you a few of the
best of them. Here!&rdquo; And Gladwin stepped over
to the corner of the room where the trunk had been
dropped and picked up a bundle of canvases.</p>
<p>The picture expert wore a broad grin as the young
man came toward him. He waved aside the proffered
bundle and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are not the best of them. Just a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached behind him and pulled down from under
his belted coat a similar carefully rolled bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the gems of your collection,&rdquo; he said
grimly, offering the slim roll of canvases. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
keep them now&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ve been too white about this
whole thing. I couldn&rsquo;t even accept &lsquo;The Blue Boy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin refused to accept the paintings and the
thief laid them down on the table. Stepping closer
to the young man, he bent down and said low and
earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a man goes wrong, Gladwin, and the going
leans against the lines of least resistance, it&rsquo;s easier to
keep on going than to stop and switch off into the
hard and narrow path. He is always hoping that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
something will take hold of him and set him right,
and that hope usually involves a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dreaming lately that I wanted something
to set me going in the right direction, but it
seems that you have beaten me to that, or are on the
fair road to do it. The trouble is that I have forgotten
how to go about a clean thing cleanly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty sorry, but&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Gladwin started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re also mighty glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall always remember you, Wilson, and here&rsquo;s
my hand on it that I shall always be willing to help
you up and out of the&ndash;&ndash;the&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The muck!&rdquo; supplied the thief, accepting Gladwin&rsquo;s
hand and gripping it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we are wasting time and keeping the
ladies up till an unconscionable hour. If you will get
your little Jap down here without making a noise
about it, I can use him and bid you good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin went warily out into the hallway, reconnoitered
the front door and vestibule, then went to
the stairway and uttered a short, sharp whistle. Bateato
came down as if on winged feet and halted as if
turned to stone between the big man in the uniform
of Officer 666 and his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; said Wilson, and plucked the Jap by
the arm.</p>
<p>Bateato trembled with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to catch the thief?&rdquo; the picture expert
asked him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bateato looked at his master, who nodded reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the thief is in your master&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; said
Wilson, impressively. &ldquo;Go up there and bang on the
door&ndash;&ndash;take that poker out of the fireplace and make
all the noise you can. Do you understand me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair,&rdquo; and Bateato&rsquo;s long lost grin returned.
&ldquo;I make bang, bang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and yell, &lsquo;Police&ndash;&ndash;quick, quick, quick&ndash;&ndash;catch
thief.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ees, sair, big much pleece come and tief run.
Bateato run too and pleece find all empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good&ndash;&ndash;hurry!&rdquo; and Wilson gave the Jap an unnecessary
push toward the fireplace, for the little Oriental
fairly flew on his errand.</p>
<p>A moment later there burst upon the stillness of
the mansion a frightful uproar. The noise was distinctly
audible in the street, as Wilson had slipped to
the door and opened it, then concealed himself behind
a curtain.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of seconds before Captain
Stone, Kearney and the entire outside patrol rushed in
and piled up the stairs.</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin had not stirred from where he
stood in the drawing-room when Bateato got his instructions.
He was intensely excited and feared that
some slip might spoil this inspired plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; came a muffled hail from the hallway.
Then there was silence both within and without.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Gad, I hope he makes it!&rdquo; cried the young man
and rushed to the window. He had hardly reached
there when the stillness was punctured by a crash of
shifting gears and the racket of a sixty horsepower
engine thrown into sudden, furious action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Gladwin breathed, as he saw a touring
car hurl itself athwart his vision. He recognized
his former servant, Watkins, at the wheel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
<h3>MICHAEL PHELAN&rsquo;S PREDICAMENT.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was as if a great burden had been removed from
his shoulders. Leaving the window and stepping
back into the room, Travers Gladwin stretched his
arms above his head and exhaled a long breath of
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I can sit down and await developments,&rdquo; he
said to himself, slipping into a chair and stretching
out his legs, &ldquo;and it will only remain for Michael
Phelan to turn up or to fail to turn up and the mystery
of the escape is explained. Poor Phelan, he
must be a terrific simpleton, and I suppose I am partly
to bla&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>His gaze had wandered to the great chest, the lid
of which was distinctly rising.</p>
<p>Before Gladwin could jump to his feet the lid was
thrown back and there sat the subject of his soliloquy
in his shirt sleeves, jerking his head about like a jack-in-the-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in blazes am I?&rdquo; he groaned as his eyes
made out Travers Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be in the chest,&rdquo; replied the young
man, covering his mouth with his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Howly murther! me uniform is gone again!&rdquo; exploded
Phelan, struggling to his feet and examining
his shirt sleeves as if he feared he were the victim of
witchcraft.</p>
<p>He climbed out of the chest and turned a vindictive
glance upon Gladwin, who composed his features and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not guilty this time, Officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phelan stared at him stupidly for a second and then
let his arms and shoulders go limp. He was a lugubriously
pathetic figure as he turned up his eyes and
muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I remember&ndash;&ndash;they took it off me and
drugged me an&rsquo; rammed me into the chest. Wurra!
Wurra! I&rsquo;m a goner now for shure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin was about to speak when there was a run
of feet on the stairs and in burst Captain Stone and
Detective Kearney. At the sight of Phelan, the captain
recoiled and his jaw dropped. Kearney likewise
regarded him in blank astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your uniform, Phelan?&rdquo; roared Captain
Stone when he could get his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took it off me&ndash;&ndash;drugged me an&rsquo; half murthered
me&ndash;&ndash;eight of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; whined Phelan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; yelled the captain. &ldquo;There was
only one of them, you numskull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to croak if there wasn&rsquo;t two of &rsquo;em with
the stren&rsquo;th of eight,&rdquo; rejoined Phelan, wiping his
dripping forehead and rolling his eyes. &ldquo;An&rsquo; they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
chloroformed me an&rsquo; stuffed me into the chest. You
can ask Mr. Gladwin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you let that thief escape in your uniform, Mike
Phelan,&rdquo; stormed the infuriated captain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break
you to-morrow. And as for you, Mr. Gladwin, if you
had a hand in this&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, captain,&rdquo; returned the young man,
&ldquo;I am unable to claim the honor. I just happened in
here as Mr. Phelan was coming out of the chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did that Jap make such a thundering racket
upstairs?&rdquo; broke in Kearney. &ldquo;The whole thing looks
to me like a frame-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travers Gladwin shrugged his shoulders and said
easily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Considering the number of policemen on the job,
does it not also take on the aspect of a slip-up? It
would make rather amusing reading in the newspapers,
but if you prefer, gentlemen, we can let the
matter drop right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Stone and Kearney looked at each other
and found no comfort in each other&rsquo;s countenances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though he got away with one hundred thousand
dollars&rsquo; worth of my paintings, slipping out from
under your very noses,&rdquo; Gladwin pressed his advantage,
&ldquo;I may, for the sake of avoiding notoriety, decide
that it is best to keep the thing quiet. Of course,
it is in your power to compel publicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not against your wishes, sir,&rdquo; said Captain Stone,
meekly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Mr. Kearney,&rdquo; smiled the young man,
looking up into the frowning visage of the much advertised
Central Office man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Stone is my superior officer,&rdquo; said Kearney
shortly, through compressed lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, Captain,&rdquo; Gladwin ran on, &ldquo;we
will just drop the incident from our minds. You will
oblige me by calling off your men at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Stone bowed and left the room, followed
by Kearney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Phelan,&rdquo; said Gladwin, turning to that distressed
individual, &ldquo;the evening&rsquo;s entertainment seems
at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a divvil of an intertainment fer me&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll be
broke to-morrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Phelan,&rdquo; and the young man walked over
and patted him on the shoulder, &ldquo;not broke&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll
resign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A swell chance I&rsquo;ve got to resign&ndash;&ndash;with no shield
to turn in. It&rsquo;ll break the heart of me poor ould
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were tears in Michael Phelan&rsquo;s voice and
his woe-begone expression was pitiable. Young Gladwin
hastened to cheer him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take it upon myself to see that you are honorably
discharged, Phelan. I can almost swear that a
little note to Captain Stone with an inclosure of say
four figures will put through your resignation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be out of a job, won&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; flared Phelan.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a minute. I am going to give you a job
for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and at twice the salary you were getting. I&rsquo;m
going to appoint you my private watchman to guard
my picture gallery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; this ain&rsquo;t one o&rsquo; your jokes?&rdquo; Phelan
asked, with a dismal effort to summon a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it is not, and here is that five hundred dollar
bill you so foolishly surrendered to my friend the
picture expert. Now, as all your fellow officers
seem to have departed you can begin your duties by
going upstairs and telling the ladies that the blockade
has been raised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Michael Phelan got the crisp saffron
bill tucked away in his jeans he was in full and glorious
grin and made for the stairway with an agility
that was a distinct revelation of hidden resources. A
few minutes later Mrs. Burton entered the room, followed
by her two nieces.</p>
<p>As her now calmer eye took in the room and the
empty picture frames, Mrs. Burton exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever have you been doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of my canvases need cleaning,&rdquo; was the
ready response, with a wink at Whitney Barnes, who
was hovering about Sadie, &ldquo;so I took the most valuable
ones out of the frames to send them to the
cleaners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton swallowed the fib and began a tour of
inspection of the room.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Your father collected some of these, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
she said after a pause. &ldquo;Your father and my father
were very good friends. I remember not so long ago
hearing him tell of that portrait of your ancestor,&rdquo;
indicating the Stuart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I like this one&ndash;&ndash;a Gainsborough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
She had stopped in front of &ldquo;The Blue Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like that one?&rdquo; cried the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s charming,&rdquo; gushed Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine! Why, I couldn&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do me the honor of accepting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what has occurred to-night? Why, I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Mrs.
Burton couldn&rsquo;t take her eyes from the picture,
and seemed thrilled with an ecstasy of admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have it packed and shipped to you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton wheeled upon him with an expression
that fairly took him to her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear, generous boy,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;if Helen
had only confided in me&ndash;&ndash;here is my card; come to
me to-morrow and we will have a family conference.
I&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; interposed Helen in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take charge of all the wedding arrangements,&rdquo;
ran on Auntie, fairly bubbling over. &ldquo;Come
early in the afternoon, Mr. Gladwin. I must get my
girls to bed. Good night&ndash;&ndash;come, girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton started for the door and Helen lingered
behind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, whatever shall I do?&rdquo; she whispered to Gladwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever your heart dictates,&rdquo; he whispered in
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did he escape?&rdquo; came the frightened query,
as she dropped her eyes and blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and they will never get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; She gave him her hand for a moment
and was gone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<h3>THE CIRCUMVENTION OF AUNTIE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Sadie sat up with a start and rubbed her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Nanette,&rdquo; she said sleepily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trim, rosy-cheeked maid smiled and swiftly left
the room.</p>
<p>She had deposited one armful of fluffy things on
a chair beside Sadie&rsquo;s bed and another armful of fluffy
things on a chair beside Helen&rsquo;s bed. She had also
performed other mysterious little offices noiselessly before
going to the side of Sadie&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sleeping like an innocent babe,&rdquo; said the
comely Nanette to herself with a depth of affection in
her tone. Then she bent down and called in Sadie&rsquo;s
ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock, Miss Sadie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had to repeat the whispered call several times
before Sadie&rsquo;s eyelids fluttered and she stirred into
life. The maid had vanished by the time the younger
of the two sleeping beauties had removed the cobwebs
from her eyes.</p>
<p>The twin rosewood beds lay side by side enveloped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
by the transparent silken hangings of a single canopy.
The room was exquisitely done in pink and everywhere
were evidences that the two lucky mortals who
slumbered therein were coddled and pampered to the
limit of modern luxury.</p>
<p>Sadie&rsquo;s robe de nuit, as the fashion magazines put
it, was a creation of laces and ribbons and mighty becoming.
She had admitted this to herself as she surveyed
her reflection in the tall oval mirror only five
hours before. She admitted it again as she hopped
out of bed and confronted herself in the same mirror.
Then she turned and ran quickly to the side of Helen&rsquo;s
bed.</p>
<p>She bent down and kissed her cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Helen,&rdquo; Sadie urged, as the blue eyes
reluctantly opened. &ldquo;Get up and dress, dear&ndash;&ndash;we
haven&rsquo;t much time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much time for what?&rdquo; asked Helen, sitting up
and going through the ceremony of rubbing her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much time before Auntie wakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A roseate blush spread up from the ribbons at
Sadie&rsquo;s throat to the roots of her fair hair.</p>
<p>Helen&rsquo;s eyes were wide open now and she looked
at her cousin in frowning puzzlement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr. Hogg is expected,&rdquo; said Sadie, with
swift inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever are you driving at?&rdquo; asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you anxious to greet Mr. Hogg?&rdquo; pouted
Sadie.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the vehement response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must be out when he comes&ndash;&ndash;and I have
an important engagement at eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen shot two little pink feet out of the covers
and planked them down on the velvety rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom have you an engagement with, Sadie Burton?&rdquo;
she asked, with breathless eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an engagement to elope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time Sadie turned her head to hide her
blushes.</p>
<p>Helen seemed actually paralyzed. There was an
intense pause before Sadie wheeled round, flung her
head defiantly and said with more fire than she had
ever in her life displayed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Mr. Whitney Barnes&ndash;&ndash;and you are going to
assist me&ndash;&ndash;you and Mr. Gladwin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;cannot&ndash;&ndash;be&ndash;&ndash;serious, Sadie?&rdquo; said the older
cousin, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, though!&rdquo; was the passionate rejoinder.
&ldquo;Nanette and I packed my steamer trunk after you
and Auntie went to bed. Hurry now, Helen, dear,
for we must be at the Little Church Around the Corner
at eleven o&rsquo;clock. I am going to wear my gray
travelling dress and you your brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you dreadful little minx, you!&rdquo; cried Helen.
&ldquo;If you are poking fun at me I will never forgive
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not poking fun,&rdquo; retorted Sadie with the
same ardor and almost in tears. &ldquo;It is all planned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
and arranged. Whitney promised to have everything
ready at the church, including Travers Gladwin. He
said he couldn&rsquo;t wait another minute after eleven
o&rsquo;clock&ndash;&ndash;that the suspense would kill him&ndash;&ndash;and he
was so terribly in earnest about it that I believe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You goose!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, but now she was
smiling and there was a happy light in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, Sadie Burton,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;that you fell in love with that young man in
a few hours&ndash;&ndash;<i>you</i>, the man-hater!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-y-yes,&rdquo; admitted Sadie, her cheeks again on fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a man you don&rsquo;t know anything about&ndash;&ndash;a perfect
stranger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brought the fire into the timid miss&rsquo;s eyes and
she returned warmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know everything about him, Helen Burton&ndash;&ndash;his
whole family history, and he is only obeying orders in
rushing the ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obeying orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his father commanded him to marry me at
once&ndash;&ndash;and if he doesn&rsquo;t obey he will be disinherited
and have to become a plumber or something to make
a living. His father is Joshua Barnes, the mustard
king&ndash;&ndash;you must have heard of him. When I told
Auntie who he was she almost collapsed and said
something about Joshua Barnes buying and selling
twenty hogs&ndash;&ndash;I suppose she meant Jabez Hogg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I never heard of such a thing, Sadie. Mr.
Barnes could not have been serious. His father never
saw you in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but he telephoned his father all about it before
he proposed to me. He was sure I would say
yes. He is a wonderful mind-reader and believes in
mysteries and Fate. He said the minute he saw me
he knew I was his Fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the modest Sadie was in a state bordering
on conflagration. Helen&rsquo;s eye sobered as she
looked at and beyond Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the very thing Travers Gladwin&ndash;&ndash;I
mean the real one&ndash;&ndash;said to me,&rdquo; she mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the way things have turned out it would
seem&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Helen stopped and covered her face with her
hands. Sadie ran to her and put her arms about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to help us, aren&rsquo;t you, Helen
dear?&rdquo; said Sadie, tremulously. &ldquo;I would tell Auntie
about it only she would want a tremendous wedding
and all that. Whitney and I both hate big weddings.
I am too timid and he is too nervous&ndash;&ndash;says he might
swallow the ring and choke to death. You will now,
Helen darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little sob in Sadie&rsquo;s voice and Helen
surrendered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are doing a very rash thing, Sadie,&rdquo; Helen
lectured, striving to draw her brows into an expression
of impressive solemnity. &ldquo;My own terrible experience
should have been a lesson to you&ndash;&ndash;a warning&ndash;&ndash;a&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But it was Whitney Barnes who saved you,
Helen!&rdquo; cried Sadie, exultantly. &ldquo;You owe it all to
him and that is why I began to love him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; retorted Helen sharply. &ldquo;Mr. Barnes
had nothing whatever to do with it. All he did was
to get himself handcuffed and run about absurdly trying
to be unlocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was on watch and planned and planned,&rdquo;
Sadie defended her hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie Burton, I say that Whitney Barnes had
nothing whatever to do with it. He was merely an
instrument. Travers Gladwin did it all. I owe everything
to him&ndash;&ndash;<i>everything</i>! He would have gone to
jail for me, sacrificed all his wonderful paintings&ndash;&ndash;oh,
Sadie, it was wonderful of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Sadie who was thunderstruck now by the ardor
in her cousin&rsquo;s voice. Her amazement soon gave
way to a beaming smile, and she mumbled as she
turned to her dressing table, &ldquo;I do believe she is in
love with him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
<h3>MISS FEATHERINGTON&rsquo;S SHATTERED DREAM.</h3>
</div>
<p>Marietta Featherington couldn&rsquo;t seem to concentrate
her mind upon that thirteenth chapter of
&ldquo;Lily the Lovely Laundress.&rdquo; The handsome rat-catcher
had just beaten the aristocratic villain to a
pulp and would have finished the job neatly and thoroughly
had not Lily raised her lovely fair hand and
cried with the imperiousness of an empress:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pause, Giovanni! Pause! He may have a
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ordinarily Miss Featherington would have raced
through the pages hungrily, avidly. Not so on this fair
November afternoon. Whether it was the mince pie
and melted cheese she had partaken of a bare hour
before, or whether it was the even-more-so-than-usual
grumpy mood of her employer, Joshua Barnes, she
could not tell. Perhaps it was neither. She refused
to analyze it. Whatever the cause, she felt heavy and
wistful and sad.</p>
<p>From time to time the emotional Miss Featherington
allowed Whitney Barnes to flit through the corridors
of her imagination. He had walked heavily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
through her dreams the night before. His strange
words of yesterday had strangely moved her. Desperately
she had striven to solve the mystery. Were
they words of love? If so, how would Old Grim
Barnes accept the declaration from his son&rsquo;s lips that
he loved the humble though, yes, though beautiful
stenographer lady of the Barnes Mustard Company,
Limited?</p>
<p>Miss Featherington had half expected to walk into
Joshua Barnes&rsquo;s presence that morning and meet with
a torrent of abuse. She had rehearsed a cold and
haughty retort. But her employer had greeted her
with a gruff, &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; and an expression that
was equivalent to a smile.</p>
<p>Alas! the prince had not spoken.</p>
<p>Marietta pounded out forty-two letters containing
references to as many different kinds of assorted and
selected mustard before she succeeded in dismissing
the heir to the mustard millions from her romantic
thoughts and creating a new hero in his stead. The
new hero some way fell down and she picked up &ldquo;Lily
the Lovely Laundress.&rdquo; But even the &ldquo;Lovely Lily&rdquo;
failed to thrill and she laid the book aside.</p>
<p>A long sigh was escaping from the depressed maiden&rsquo;s
bosom when the door of the anteroom opened
and who should enter but Whitney Barnes. Marietta
swallowed her sigh and clasped her hand over her
palpitating heart.</p>
<p>The young man was not alone, however, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
did not deign Miss Featherington a glance as he held
the door open and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children were none other than Helen and Sadie
and Travers Gladwin. Nor did they deign Miss
Featherington a glance as they assembled in a little
group, talking in hushed tones and punctuating their
talk with suppressed laughter.</p>
<p>By the time Whitney Barnes did turn to Marietta
that young lady&rsquo;s nose was elevated to an excruciating
angle&ndash;&ndash;so much so that she was unable to fulfill her
desire to sniff. There was cold hauteur in her stare
as she met the smile of Whitney Barnes and replied
to his query:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Barnes, your father is in and alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Featherington,&rdquo; cried the young
man, gaily, and an instant later the little party of four
had vanished behind a mahogany portal.</p>
<p>Joshua Barnes was bent over his desk writing, as
the door opened noiselessly and the four young people
entered. When he looked up his son, Travers Gladwin
and Helen were lined up beside his chair, the two
young men smiling sheepishly and the girls blushing
crimson and looking down at the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Pater,&rdquo; opened Whitney Barnes, &ldquo;you remember
Travers Gladwin. This is Mrs. Gladwin, a
bride of sixty-seven minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Grim Barnes was on his feet in an instant with
a gallant bow to Helen and a hearty handshake for
the bridegroom.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></div>
<p>For a second or two he failed to descry Sadie, who,
as per rehearsal, was hidden behind the two young
men. As, with a look of surprise, he spied her, Helen
drew Sadie to her and managed to stammer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is my cousin Sadie, Mr. Barnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie dropped a timid courtesy, her face on fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss&ndash;&ndash;er&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Joshua Barnes was feasting his eyes on Sadie&rsquo;s shy
beauty and smiling benignly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t catch the name,&rdquo; he added, turning to
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B-b-b,&rdquo; she began, when Whitney Barnes came to
her rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barnes, pater&ndash;&ndash;Mrs. Sadie; that is, Mrs. Whitney
Barnes&ndash;&ndash;a bride of seventy-seven minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whitney Barnes beamed upon his father and put
his arm about the old gentleman&rsquo;s shoulders to support
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you like my choice, dad?&ndash;&ndash;isn&rsquo;t she a darling?
Why don&rsquo;t you ask to kiss the bride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joshua Barnes breathed with difficulty for a moment
and his eyes blinked. Slowly he looked for confirmation
in the faces of the newlywed Gladwins, and
when they both nodded and smiled, he returned his
glance to Sadie, who had turned very pale and was
beginning to tremble.</p>
<p>The mustard king shook off his son&rsquo;s arm and gathered
Sadie to him with a bear hug.</p>
<p>He kissed her ten times in succession and then let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
her down in his chair and patted her shoulder. Joshua
Barnes was so happy that tears glistened in his eyes.
He continued to look at Sadie for a long moment before
he turned to his son and gulped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whitney Barnes, you scoundrel&ndash;&ndash;have you been
keeping this from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no, dad,&rdquo; came the laughing answer. &ldquo;I
telephoned you about it last night, and you called me&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time in my life I made a mistake,
Whitney Barnes,&rdquo; his father checked him, &ldquo;and you
both have my blessing a thousandfold&ndash;&ndash;provided you
will take me in as a boarder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; exclaimed Whitney Barnes.</p>
